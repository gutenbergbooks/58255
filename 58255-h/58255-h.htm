<p class="noindent">The Play School Series, of which <i>Educating
by Story-Telling</i> is a member, is based
on the work of the Demonstration Play
School of the University of California.
Breaking away from the traditional idea
of the subjects of study, this school has
substituted a curriculum of activities—the
natural activities of child life—out of
which subjects of study naturally evolve.
Succeeding volumes now in active preparation
will relate to the other activities
which form the educational basis for the
work of the Play School, including Social,
Linguistic, Moral, Big-Muscle, Rhythmic
and Musical, Environmental and Nature,
and Economic Activities. Each volume
will be written by a recognized authority
in the subject dealt with, as the author of
<i>Educating by Story-Telling</i> is in her special
field.</p>

<h2 id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>

<p>This book has grown out of years of experience
with children of all ages and all classes, and with
parents, teachers, librarians, and Sunday School, social
center, and settlement workers. The material comprising
it was first used in something like its present
form in the University of California Summer Session,
1914, and since then has been the basis of courses
given in that institution, as well as in private classes
and lecture work. The author does not claim that it
is the final word upon the subject of story-telling, or
that it will render obsolete any one of the several excellent
works already upon the market. But the
response of children to the stories given and suggested,
and the eagerness with which the principles
herein advocated have been received by parents and
teachers, have convinced her that the book contains
certain features that are unique and valuable to those
engaged in directing child thought.</p>

<p>Other works have shown in a general way how vast
a field is the realm of the narrator, but they have not
worked out a detailed plan that the busy mother or
teacher can follow in her effort to establish standards,
to lead her small charges to an appreciation of the
beautiful in literature and art, and to endow them
with knowledge that shall result in creating a higher
code of thought and action. No claim is made that
all the problems of the school and home are solved
in the ensuing pages, and the title, “Educating by
Story-Telling,” makes no assumption that story-telling
can accomplish everything. The author does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
assume, however, that when used with wisdom and
skill, the story is a powerful tool in the hands of the
educator, and she attempts to indicate how, by this
means, some portion of drudgery may be eliminated
from the schoolroom, and a more pleasurable element
be put into it. She undertakes to demonstrate how
it is possible to intensify the child’s interest in most
of the subjects composing the curriculum, not by
advancing an untried theory, but by traveling along a
path that has been found to be a certain road to attainment,
not only for the gifted creative teacher, but for
the average ordinary one who is often baffled by the
bigness of the problem she has to solve.</p>

<h2 id="EDITORS_INTRODUCTION">EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The story is a phase of communication—the instinctive
tendency to signal and transmit feelings
and ideas and to respond to such expressions—and
communication is associated with the social complex
of instincts and emotions as indicated by these
responses. Through the power of social sympathy
in this complex, curiosity and the imagination are
brought under the sway of communication, especially
in the story. Indeed, the psychology of the story
reveals how deeply social sympathy influences the
imagination and controls curiosity. The primitive
side of this social sympathy is seen in the responses
of social animals to the calls of their kind, in the rush
of dogs and men to the cries of battle. Its power over
the imagination is shown in the swaying of the spectator
to the movements of the athlete, his ejaculations
and his cries of distress or delight. Through sympathy
in imagination the spectator enters the contest.
Further, so socially minded are we, and so dependent
upon social guidance, that curiosity is nowhere so
keen, nor the imagination so active, as in the communication
of a life situation. Any incident or accumulation
of incidents that we call a plot in the
experience of an individual or group of individuals,
grips the mind. This explains the fascination of the
story. Gossip and scandal are the less worthy forms.
The novel is exalted gossip or scandal; the drama
the same acted out. They all feed the tremendous
hunger for insight into life. They unroll the curtain
on the content of life, or some phase of life. Hence
the story is the natural form for revealing life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Communication, like life, may be either serious or
frivolous; hence the story carries both functions. It
pictures or expresses life in both phases. But the
form of the story itself is pleasurable; and thus story-telling
may degenerate into mere amusement. This
possibly has led to both its abuse and its neglect.</p>

<p>The fact that the story is so enjoyable to children
has led teachers and parents to use it merely as amusement,
irrespective of content, or even of artistic form.
This tendency has been met by publishers. As proof,
note the books exhibited at Christmas time in any
bookshop. They show the enormous amount of trash
set up in book form for child consumption. This is
a more serious danger than the trash read by adults,
because they are food for hungry minds at the growing
age. The importance is shown of selecting stories
according to recognized criteria. While the child
enjoys the story, he has no judgment of values in the
story other than its pleasure-giving qualities. As
judgment is a product of education, so judging values
is an adult function; the adult must study all stories,
but not tell all stories. The story-teller must analyze
the story plot, criticize the values, select and adapt
stories to age periods and to other child needs. This
task Mrs. Cather has performed in her book.</p>

<p>The mere fact that the story amuses has caused a
neglect of its larger functions in education. This is
due to the traditional attitude toward the pleasurable
in education. Education is life, and synonymous with
the joys and griefs of life; but the traditions of the
school when it was a place simply to master the three
R’s, and the traditions of intellectualism, monkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
asceticism, and Puritanism, have conspired to perpetuate
the idea of education as a “hard” process.
That it is “hard” is demonstrated by the vast number
of children who dislike school and drop out of it before
finishing the grades, and by the small number of those
who go through its process and think of education and
its discipline with delight. Yet this is what all normal,
vigorous children should feel. There is probably no
more profound or serious issue in education or democracy—and
democracy depends on education—than
this conflict between the advocates of a school
process that is “hard” and the advocates of a process
that is “pleasurable.” The arguments exhibit the
two extremes in all such controversies: the advocates
of “discipline,” “iron,” “the bitter pill” on the one
hand, and the advocates of “freedom” and “enjoyment,”—really
soft pedagogy and license,—on the
other. The truth, as is usually the case, lies between
the two schools. Both are right in part, and both
are wrong in part. Both see an essential, and both
fail to see the reverse side of what each advocates.
There is no conflict between real discipline and real
pleasure; they cannot be separated in child life.
This being so, the story is bound to take a large place
in the teaching of the future.</p>

<p>The story amuses, but its function is not merely
to amuse. Pleasure is not the aim of life, nor even
its sole guide; it is an index of life, especially in the
young.</p>

<p>The point needs to be emphasized that the story is
the carrier, always has been the carrier, and will
remain the natural carrier of racial tradition or information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
and ideals. The story in education has two functions:
(1) it is the molder of ideals, and (2) it is the
illuminator of facts.</p>

<p>(1) The highest and most difficult achievement in
educational effort is the establishment of standards
or ideals that function in judgment and behavior.
The place of the story in moral education has been
emphasized by many writers. Its place in developing
an appreciation of artistic forms in language, in
music, and in the graphic arts is splendidly illustrated
in this book.</p>

<p>Appreciation is an emotional response, primarily
instinctive, but developed through experience and
according to high or low artistic standards by social
approval or disapproval. In the emotional response
lies interest and in the character of the emotional response
lies the character of the interest. The interest
may be crude, vulgar, or vicious, or it may be ideal,
but in either case it is a product of developed emotional
habits. In the life of the child this emotional response
precedes the intellectual judgment of artistic values
which comes later and only through contrast and comparison,
and the former is vastly more important in
social significance for the pleasure of the mass than
the latter. This development of the artistic emotional
response may be cleverly guided through the story,
as Mrs. Cather shows, and she gives a wealth of suggestions
for the use of the teacher.</p>

<p>But the story itself is a form of artistic expression
and thus subject to the application of standardizing
judgments. A good story must be judged by a double
standard. It may be good in the sense that it is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
told—and well told means simply that the incident
or plot is related in sequence, with such emphasis and
form of language that it grips the human instinctive
response to the dramatic; or it may be good in the
sense that it carries a good content in meaning or ideal.
These two standards may not, frequently do not,
coincide. A story may be so told that it is most fascinating,
and yet the content be mere rubbish or even
vicious; or the content may be correct and the telling
so poorly done that it kills interest.</p>

<p>Many stories are told because of their “beauty”
of form, where the content is not true. Some such
stories are valuable because of the standardizing
sentiments they carry, but truth is as important at
least as the æsthetic. The human intellect evolved
to interpret meanings and progressively perfect behavior
adjustments. Each age of racial experience
brings on its new interpretations, and broadly, each
age makes advances upon that which preceded. Old
theories fall, new truths arise; but old theories hold
sway over the imagination of the masses long after
the leaders have accepted higher truths because the
old is well told while the new lacks the poetic expression
of the artist. Literature is well-told information,
yet under the guise of literature goblins
and superstitions and worn-out theories parade in
the imagination and thus mold ideals and behavior.</p>

<p>The problem of the professional story-teller of the
future is to tell the best information of the age in as
fascinating a form as the old myths and fables
are now told after years of repetition. Only in
this way can contemporary popular opinion be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
abreast of the scientific truth of the time, instead of
dragging along in the superstitions of the past.</p>

<p>Some stories are told though untrue, because they
“develop the imagination,” but this by itself is a
dangerous criterion. The function of the imagination
is to reconstruct the world in mental terms which will
guide behavior. The functioning of the imagination
in any kind of images will develop “power,” but the
power may be detrimental individually and socially
if the images cause crooked thinking. Straight thinking
depends on the imagination—on the kind of
emotionalized images which habitually arise in any
thought situation or problem. Just so far as stories
are untrue and without great moral value, yet are
fascinatingly told, so far do they encourage untrue
imagining and emotional attitudes, and therefore untrue
thinking. And inasmuch as the emotional response to
the single interpretative concept, the single vision of
life, is vastly stronger through tradition than the interest
in the discovery of complex relationships,—and truth
comes finally only through the latter,—the emotionalized
habits of imagination in interpretation are profoundly
important for democracy.</p>

<p>Democracy cannot exist with a population of fuzzy
thinkers. Story-telling, like all educational effort,
must develop the imagination in mental terms that
will function in life today.</p>

<p>(2) The story is an illuminator of facts. The child
gets his information by activities in relation to the
environment, by exploration, observation, experimentation,
with the everlasting play of the interpretative
processes, and by responding to and accepting or rejecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the communicated interpretations put upon
phenomena by his social group. In this process of
interpretation there is the immediate environment
which can be sensed, but is understood only through
its reconstruction in the imagination, largely in linguistic
terms; and the remote environment which
cannot be sensed and which can be understood only
as it is built in the imagination as an extension of the
reconstructed sensed environment. In these reconstructive
processes the story is the most powerful
correlating and illuminating educational force we have,
as may be indicated by a brief analysis.</p>

<p>The activities of the school curriculum dealing with
the environment have two natural foci of interest for
the child. (<i>a</i>) The civic-geographical-historical complex
(when rightly organized just one subject) and
(<i>b</i>) the physical-biological complex, which is now
coming to be called “general science.” For the child
these two groups of the environmental activities cover
the whole of adult science, philosophy, and religion,
and both require a tremendous reconstructive functioning
of the imagination.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The first group is a new coming correlation
which naturally must carry with it organized communication
or the larger share of language and literature.
The investigation of the local social environment
is the basis of all “civics,” “geography,” and “history.”
It expands as civics. When the child projects his
interpretations of any human activity into another
environment so that he is reconstructing in his imagination
the life habits and customs of the people
in relation to the physical and biological characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
of the country, he is studying geography. When
he goes backward in time in this process, he is studying
history.</p>

<p>In this concentric widening of the intellectual horizon
concerning human life and its relationships to the
environment, the imagination must reconstruct a
world which it cannot sense. The facts may be gained
from pictures, maps, descriptions, but to become
functional in thought in any other than in a mere
commercial sense, the reconstruction must touch the
emotions so that the life and conditions of living of
the people will be felt. When felt the life will be dwelt
upon in imagination, and when dwelt upon in imagination
it will function in the life activities of the child.
Giving this vivid, felt insight into the life conditions
of other people is the function of the story. Through
the hunger to feel life the story reveals life.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The story also functions for children in the
interpretation of the physical-biological environment
or “general science.”</p>

<p>Between six and fourteen years of age is the neglected
period for science, and it is the age when the story may
function in the biggest way as a natural educational
tool. Yet so absorbed are school men in the problem
of drilling children in the dissected elements of the
written language that they do not even understand
one of the two chief characteristics of child nature at
this age,—the rapidly expanding curiosity concerning
nature. It is the age of the first crude control of
the “scientific instinct,” the tendency to experiment
and explore. It is the age for fixing the questioning
habit and building a common-sense confidence in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
familiarity with nature. These results follow from the
logical processes involved in the activities, not from
being presented with the formalized and logical results
of adult science. The child will have none of this
latter if he can help it; he wants to do his own experimenting.
In this process again the story gives
the larger insight. The child acquires facts by experimentation,
observation, exploration, but the larger
meanings and relationships require imaginative reconstruction.
The child can observe the fish or the fly
at different stages of their development, but the story
of the life history of the fish or fly gives what observation
cannot supply. It is as fascinating as any fairy
tale when told with the same consideration for dramatic
form, and the story is true besides. The child cannot
understand evolution as presented by Darwin, or by
the teacher of biology in the high schools; but the
child even of eight revels in the stories that carry
the facts of evolution, and thus he gains a right feeling
towards the wonderful meaning of the progress of
natural things, which makes later thinking true and
easy. So strong is the response to the story that even
the history of physical things when set in a natural
story form, stimulates.</p>

<p>The fairy tales of the future will be well-told stories
from our sciences or human life and nature, the two
natural centers of interest in the environment, and
we may expect as results in public opinion a broader
common sense and a lessened gullibility. In this
organization of science and modern thought in story
form for its larger use in education the professional
story-teller has still a great unfinished task to perform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
Its beginnings are in this book, and Mrs. Cather is
already at work on a broader compilation of materials
for a later volume. In this larger functioning of the
story the old fairy tales and myths will take their place
as historical data to give comparative insight into the
beliefs of people in the past, a sympathetic understanding
of their limitations in knowledge, and an appreciation
of our privileges in civilization, due largely to the
struggles of the past.</p>

<p>Ever since the beginning of things the story-teller
has been a personage of power, an individual
welcomed by young and old alike. Hailed as a joy
bringer and heeded as an oracle, his tales have been
the open sesame to admit him to any throng and his
departure has always been attended with regret.
During the Middle Ages he was a privileged character,
free to wander at will into camp or court. The Piso
manuscript in the museum at Budapest tells of the
solicitous effort made by Ladislaus of Hungary to
secure safe-conduct through Bohemia and Austria for
a favorite narrator, and many other old chronicles
attest to the fact that in France, Germany, Italy, and
the British Isles passports were given to minstrels
and raconteurs when no one else could obtain them.
Long before this period, during the nomadic existence
of the race, the mightiest men of the tribe were the
chieftain and the story-teller, the one receiving homage
because of his ability to vanquish his adversaries in
battle, the other because of his skill in entertaining
his fellows as they huddled around the fire at night.
Each ability was believed to be evidence of divine
gifts, and the possessor of each was revered as being
a little higher than a mortal, a little lower than a god.</p>

<p>Primitive man, like civilized man, was fond of power,
and realizing that his talents made him mighty, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
narrator exercised them in such a manner as to promote
their development. Every emotional response
on the part of his hearers served as a key to unlock
doors into the land of his desire, and as he listened to
exclamations of approval, condemnation, or delight,
he saw ways of arousing these emotions to even greater
degrees of intensity and, possessing an elemental
love of the spectacular, made the most of his opportunity.
Thus he evolved from a crude declaimer into
something of an artist. As the race emerged from
a barbaric into a pastoral state, he grew to be more
than an entertainer; he imparted knowledge to the
young by keeping alive the tribal traditions.</p>

<p>On the Asiatic highlands, before the Aryan migration,
it was the story-teller who preserved the tales
of the fathers, the nature myths that were primitive
man’s explanation of the things he did not understand.
The journey of the sun across the heavens, the shifting
of clouds from one fantastic form to another, the chromatic
skies of sunrise and sunset, and the starry
firmament of night aroused his curiosity and awakened
his awe. He wondered about them just as children
today wonder about them, and just as the twentieth-century
child questions his mother, so he questioned
one whom he deemed wiser than himself. This consulted
oracle gave as an explanation something that
out of his own wondering and puzzling had grown into
a vague belief, and consequently the clouds that presaged
showers came to be regarded as heavenly cows
from whose exuberant udders came the rains that
refreshed the earth; stormy oceans and rugged mountains
with ravines beset with perils held giants that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
avenged and destroyed; while the sun, a beneficent
creature that drove away the monster of darkness,
and all the saving forces of nature, were metamorphosed
in the fancy of these early men into protecting
heroes and divinities.</p>

<p>As generation succeeded generation and the young
received their allotment of lore from the old, these
stories became fixed so firmly in the minds of the people
that they were carried with them at the scattering
of the tribes, told and retold in the new-found homes,
and modified to suit conditions of life in strange lands
the wanderers came to inhabit; and they still survive
as present-day fairy tales. There are various theories
of how these old beliefs came to be disseminated, how
it happened that tales supposed to be indigenous to
Finland or Madagascar are found in slightly different
dress among the tribes of Central Africa and in other
sections of the world remote from each other; but
no matter how much folklorists disagree as to the process
through which the tales evolved to their present
form, they do not differ as to their significance, and
whether they accept the Aryan theory promulgated by
Max Müller or the totemistic theory of Andrew Lang,
they unite in a belief that these ancient tales represent
the religion of primitive man, a religion growing out
of fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>Always it was by the lips of the story-teller that the
legends were kept alive. It was his mission to teach
children the tales their fathers knew, and as the race
evolved toward civilization he gave them something
besides nature myths. He recounted and reiterated
the achievements of the heroes of his people until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
youths who heard were fired with desire to emulate.
Because he was deemed a man of supernal powers,
his words were believed; consequently he created the
ideals of the age in which he lived, and just as his
own standards were fine or base, so the ideals for
which he was responsible came to be high or low.
Fortunately for the world, however, these old-time
narrators were wiser than their fellows. They were
poets and dreamers who saw life through eyes vision
clear. They glorified virtue and deprecated vice,
taught that right triumphs over wrong and that sinning
brings inevitable punishment, and explained in
a crude way the workings of the law of compensation.
They fired men to achievement just as they fired boys
with desire to emulate the heroes of whom they told,
and as centuries passed and they grew in skill and
power, their tales came to be the inspiration of some
of the most thrilling chapters in the annals of man.
Alexander the Great declared that the lays of a wandering
bard, Homer, made him thirst for conquest. In
Germany, in the twelfth century, the influence of a
penniless gleeman, Walther von der Vogelweide, was
greater than that of the Pope. There was no more
puissant man in Ireland when Ireland was in its golden
day and Tara in its glory than the low-born minstrel,
Brian of Fermanagh; and the Crusades, which recreated
Europe by the introduction of Eastern culture
and the breaking down of old traditions, might never
have been undertaken but for tales of defilement of
holy places from the lips of Peter the Hermit. Storytellers
every one of them, swaying their fellows and
making history, subjects of kings and nobles, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
often mightier than the masters who held their destinies
in their hands.</p>

<p>The power of the narrator did not die with chivalry.
As recently as during the middle of the last century
the clergy of Scotland united in an effort to suppress
story-telling in the Highlands because it kept alive
beliefs of pagan origin, beliefs so deep-seated that the
combined eloquence of prelates could not eradicate
them, and the strength of the church was impaired
because of the sheltering of these waifs of the past.
To this day there are peasants in Germany who doubt
not that every year at harvest time Charlemagne
walks beside the Rhine under the midnight moon and
blesses the vineyard region of Winkel and Ingelheim.
In central Switzerland are hundreds of simple folk
who believe that on the summit where they met to
take the oath that fired the land against Austria,
sleep the immortal “Brothers of the Grütli,” and that
they will slumber on until the liberty of Helvetia is
imperiled; while in the southern portion of that mountain
land the country folk are certain that prosperity
will be the lot of every husbandman when the swan-drawn
luck boat returns to Lake Geneva. Why?
Because their fathers in the far-off days believed these
tales; because they have come down to them by the
lips of the story-teller, and wherever there is no written
language, wherever the people are too unlettered to
read what is written, or where they live in isolated
communities and mingle little with the outside world,
they still believe the legends. They love to hear them
told and retold, and nothing brings so much pleasure on a
winter night or in a summer gloaming as the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
family circle and the father or uncle or stranger from
another community sitting in the midst repeating the
old, old tales.</p>

<p>As it is with unlettered peasants today, as it was
with tribesmen in primitive times and with the great
in medieval castle halls, it still is with the child. He
lives over the experience of his fathers on the Asiatic
highlands and sits entranced listening to the record
of it in stories. The element of suspense, the wondering
what will happen next, holds him in a viselike grip,
and the story hour is to him a period of joy. The here
and now disappears as the narrator lifts his invisible
wand, and the listener journeys by roads of never
ceasing wonders into lands of enchantment. According
to the skill of the raconteur, and the vividness with
which he himself sees and feels the pictures he strives
to portray, he makes his listeners see and feel them,
rejoicing in the good fortune and sympathizing in the
sorrows of the just and righteous; and they not only
follow along the highroad where he leads them, but
roam off into pleasant bypaths where the fancy has
free play.</p>

<p>There is no age or racial limit to this story love.
Representing, as it does, an emotional hunger that
is the human heritage, it is universal. Several years
ago at Five Points in New York City, a settlement
worker discovered that a very effective means of gaining
the confidence of immigrant women was to tell
fairy tales, and recently some of the most gratifying
results obtained in the Telegraph Hill district of San
Francisco were made possible by a leader there gaining
the good will of a group of Sicilian hoodlums because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
she knew the plot of <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i> and told the
story magnetically and well. It was like a breeze from
their native island, where they had heard it from
the lips of the village story-teller and seen it pictured
on the market carts, and the fact that she knew something
that had fascinated them gained their sympathy
and coöperation. Those who have even a limited
knowledge of child life know that before the babe can
read he delights in listening to a nursery tale, and that
even after he journeys into bookland he is more interested
in the story told him than in the one he reads
for himself. Why? Because the voice and personality
of the speaker make it alive and vital. Because,
as Seumas MacManus says, “The spoken word is
the remembered word.”</p>

<p>The tales heard during childhood become fixed and
lasting possessions. They stay with the hearer through
the years, and because their ideals become his ideals,
do much toward shaping his character. The child
who hears many good stories and unconsciously learns
to distinguish between the tawdry and the real, reads
good stories when a boy and becomes a man for whom
sensational best sellers have no charm.</p>

<p>There is much talk about the vicious tastes of the
youth of this generation, and unfavorable comparisons
between them and their elders at a similar age are
frequently made. There is some foundation for this belief,
but it is not the fault of the children that it is so.
Because of the abundance and cheapness of books, many
of them of questionable merit, boys and girls are left
to browse unguided, and just as the range man is
to blame if his hungry herd strays into a loco patch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and eats of noxious weeds when he fails to drive it to
the place of wholesome herbage, so it is the fault of
parents and teachers if their charges acquire a taste for
sensational yarns instead of for good literature. The
very hunger that impels them toward that which contaminates,
if satisfied in a wholesome manner would
make them lovers of the best, and the reason why
children become devourers of “yellow” stories is because
they have failed to stumble upon a more fascinating
and less dangerous highway, and no one has
led them to it. There is no surer way of keeping a boy
from becoming a devotee of the funny page of the
Sunday supplement or a follower of “Nick Carter”
than that of studying his tastes and giving him tales
from good literature that will satisfy them. There is
no more powerful means to use in diverting a child
from the undesirable to the desirable than that of
throwing a searchlight upon the attractions of the latter
and presenting them to him through joyful experience.
The narrator’s art is in truth a magic luminary, an unfailing
means of bringing hidden beauties to sight and
causing them to be loved because they give pleasure.</p>

<p>For a number of years it has been conceded that
story-telling is of value in the kindergarten and primary
school, but little provision has been made for
it in the educational scheme for the older child. Gradually,
however, educators in America have come to
realize what their European colleagues realized long
ago, that the narrator’s art can be a powerful element
in the mental, moral, and religious development of
the boy and girl and can mean as much to the adolescent
child as to the tiny tot. Consequently they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
are now giving it an honored place. The story
period has become a part of the program of every
well-regulated library. Teachers of elementary and
grammar grades are recognizing its value in the classroom,
and in some states story-telling is included in the
curriculum. Each year brings new texts and collections
from the publishers, until it seems that the art
so much honored in the past is coming again into its
own.</p>

<p>Yet, with all the interest that is manifested throughout
the country, story-telling is not doing its greatest,
most vital work, because so little thought is given to
the selection of material, so little study to the response
of children who hear the tales and the effect upon them.
Before even half of its possibilities can be realized,
those who tell stories must know the story interests
of childhood and must choose materials, not only because
they are beautiful in theme and language and
embody high ideals, but because they are fitted to the
psychological period of the child who is to hear them.
They must realize that the purpose of story-telling is
not merely to entertain, although it does entertain,
but that in addition to delighting young listeners
there must be a higher aim, of which the narrator
never loses sight. Every tale selected must contribute
something definite toward the mental, moral, or
spiritual growth of the child, just as each pigment
chosen by an artist must blend into the picture to help
make a beautiful and perfect whole. The golden age
of childhood will come and fear that young people’s
tastes are being vitiated will die out when parents and
teachers realize that much of the noblest culture of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
past has been given through the medium of the story,
and that it can be given through this medium now and in
the future, because there is almost no type of information
the child should receive that he will not receive joyously
through this means, and with deep, lasting results.
Story-telling planned and carried out to fit conditions
will help to solve many of the problems that confront
educators today. Besides developing the emotional
nature and giving moral and religious instruction, it
will intensify the interest in history, geography, nature
study, manual training, and domestic science, awaken
an appreciation of literature, art, and music, enrich
the child’s powers of discrimination, and teach him to
distinguish between the cheap and ephemeral and the
great and lasting. It will help to eliminate much of
what he considers the drudgery of school life and give
him information that will fit him for broad, sympathetic,
useful living.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the teacher is to do all the
work, thereby fixing children in habits of idleness,
nor does it mean the addition of an extra subject to
an already overcrowded curriculum. It simply means
leading the child to do things for himself because of
the incentive that interest gives. It means illuminating
the formal subjects and sending pupils to them with
greater eagerness.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish these ends, story-telling must
be unmarred by creaking machinery, and it must be
sympathetic. The narrator must rise above the level
of a mere lesson giver and approach the plane of the
artist, which he can do only by giving an artist’s preparation
to his work. The old-time raconteur swayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the destiny of nations because he was an artist, because
he himself believed in the message he brought.
He put heart and labor into his work, which gave his
words a sincerity that never failed to convince. So
too must the present-day narrator believe in the power
of the story and in the dignity of his work, and he
must choose material with thought and judgment
instead of snatching it up indifferently, thinking that
any story will do if only it holds the interest. The
racial tales should be given freely in the psychological
period to which they belong, but not the racial tales
only. There is much modern material close to present-day
life and conditions, without which the child’s
education is not complete, and it must be classified and
graded. This entails reference work for which the
non-professional has neither time nor opportunity,
and to this fact is due much of the valueless story-telling
of today. Experience with hundreds of parents,
teachers, and workers with children has brought conviction
that a belief in the value of story-telling as an
educational tool is sincere and general, but that sources
of classified material are not available to the average
child leader. It is partly to meet this need that the
present work is planned.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Story Interests of Childhood</span></h3>

<h4>A. RHYTHMIC PERIOD</h4>

<p>If the work of the narrator is to be of real value, he
must have a knowledge of the story interests of childhood,
for otherwise the talent of a Scheherazade, careful
preparation, and an extensive repertoire will fail to
produce the desired results, because a narrative that
deals with mythical heroes cannot make a lasting
impression upon a child who craves animal and primitive
wonder tales, even though it be written in language
and style suited to his understanding. The heart
or framework of the story must be made up of events
that are fraught with interest in his particular period
of mental development, and must introduce personages
with whom he would like to companion, and whose
movements he will follow with approval, pity, condemnation,
or rejoicing. Under such conditions the boys
or girls or dogs who contribute to the action of the tale
are not strangers out of a book, but mean as much to
him as the people and animals he knows, and because
they do mean much he lives the tale. It becomes
part of him and he of the story. His emotional nature
is stirred, his power of evaluating is strengthened, and
some of the foundation blocks of character are laid.</p>

<p>Naturally the question arises, “How is one to know
which tales to choose, when there is such a wealth of
stories and such a diversity of interests? Is there any
rule or guide to keep the conscientious but untrained
worker from the pitfalls and show him the right road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
from the wrong?” Such a guide there is—the psychological
axiom that the child between birth and
maturity passes through several periods or stages of
mental growth which determines his interests.</p>

<p>The little child, the one from the age of about three
to six, is interested in familiar things. He has not
yet reached the period of fancy during which he
wanders into a world of make-believe and revels
with fairies and nixies, but dwells in a realm of
realism. His attention is centered on the things
and the personages he knows,—the mother, the
father, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cows, chickens, and
children of his own age,—and consequently he enjoys
stories and jingles about these creatures. He
chuckles over the accounts of their merry experiences
and sympathizes with them in their misfortunes, because
they lie close to his interests. This is why
Mother Goose has been and is beloved of little children.
The rhymes do not introduce griffins and ogres and
monsters that must be seen through eyes of fancy to
be seen at all, but abound in accounts of creatures
he has beheld from his windows and associated with
in his home. Mother Hubbard and her unfortunate
dog, the crooked man and his grotesque cat, the pigs
that went to market, and the old woman in the shoe
lie close to his world because he knows dogs and cats
and pigs and kind old women, and therefore the rhymes
and jingles that portray them are dear to his heart.</p>

<p>Especially fascinating in this period of early childhood
are stories that contain much repetition. “The
Old Woman and Her Pig,” “Little Red Hen,” “Chicken
Little,” “The Gingerbread Man,” and “The Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Billy Goats” delight little people, and although they
have heard them again and again they always watch
eagerly for the “Fire, fire, burn stick,” “I saw it with
my eyes, I heard it with my ears, and a piece of it fell
on my tail,” and are disappointed if the well-known
expressions are omitted. The repetition strengthens
the dramatic element and helps to make the pictures
vivid, and the child loves to experience again the
thrill he felt upon first listening to the tale.</p>

<p>Stories introducing the cries and calls of animals
are much loved at this period. The squealing of the
pig, the barking of the dog, the clucking of the hen,
and the quacking of the duck give charm to a narrative
because the child has heard those sounds in his
own garden, in his own dooryard, and along the road,
and knowing them, is interested in them. This is the
secret of the success of many kindergarten tales that
fall far below the requirements of a good story. Often
almost devoid of plot and lacking in suspense element,
still they hold the attention because of the animal
cries and calls they contain. The little hearer chuckles
as the baby pig squeals, the mother pig grunts, or the
dog barks, and listens delightedly to what, without
these cries and calls, would not interest him.</p>

<p>This too is why the racial tales fascinate today
just as they fascinated five hundred years ago. They
have a clearly defined plot that of itself would hold the
interest, they introduce familiar characters, contain
much repetition, and abound in animal cries and calls.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, then, for the period of early childhood,
the time of realism which extends from the age
of about three to five or six, the narrator should choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stories of animal and child life, those which introduce
sounds peculiar to the characters and which abound
in repetition.</p>

<p>But he should not make the mistake of following
this rule too literally or his efforts will result in failure,
because children live under widely different conditions.
The boy of the city slums, whose horizon extends
only from his own row of tenements to the next row
up the street, will not be held by tales of cows and sheep,
because he does not know cows and sheep. His knowledge
of four-footed creatures is confined to dogs and
cats and an occasional horse that goes by hitched to
the wagon of a fruit or vegetable vender, and the tales
that mean something to him are those of animals of
his world, and of children. Many a settlement and
social worker has learned the truth of this through
sad experience. A most gifted story-teller in a New
York settlement house gave to her group “The Ugly
Duckling,” and gave it exquisitely too, but it meant
nothing to the children because they never had been in
the country. A barnyard was as remote from their
interest as a treatise on philology is from that of a Finnish
peasant. They did not know ducks and geese
and chickens, and consequently punched their neighbors
and grew pestiferous during the recital of a tale
that would have entranced country children.</p>

<p>The same mistake was made by a professional
story-teller who gave a coyote tale to a group of Italian
children. They never had met this “outcast in gray,”
never had shivered as he howled in the night, and the
story brought no pictures before their eyes. They
were inattentive and disorderly throughout its rendition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the narrator declared them an impossible
group. Yet that same afternoon a college girl with
no special training in story-telling told them of a lost
nanny goat, and they sat fascinated. In the first
instance the trouble was not with the children but
with the narrator. She knew much of technique but
little of psychology and could not hold the children’s
attention, while the other girl, possessed of far less
native ability, entertained them because she understood
the story interests of childhood. The narrator
must have, not only an understanding of the psychological
periods and interests of childhood, but a knowledge
of the environment of the children with whom
she works.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of sources from which to draw for
this early period. Often it is necessary to adapt
material, because many a tale whose framework is
suited to little people is told in language beyond their
understanding. “David and Jonathan,” by Elizabeth
Stuart Phelps, is a good example. Written for adults,
yet it is so universal in its appeal that the lad of six
listens to it with as much sympathy as his father or
mother. The account of the affection of dog and master
for each other, the pathos of the separation and the
joy of the reunion, touch him as much as they touch
his parents, and to receive it from the lips of one who
feels and loves the tale will make him kinder to dumb
animals and gentler to the aged.</p>

<p>This is true of many another story that is the creation
of an artist. I mention particularly Ouida’s
“Dog of Flanders,” John Muir’s “Stickeen,” and
Ernest Thompson Seton’s “Monarch, the Big Bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of Tallac,” each of which I have used with children of
all ages. The characters in them are living, breathing
creatures, the kind that if met in real life would arouse
affection and awaken both laughter and tears, and
whether these stories are told in monosyllabic language
or colored by fine rhetorical effects, they strike the
tender places and appeal to the best. When the
child meets Nello before the altar of the cathedral in
Antwerp, kneeling in front of a painting by Rubens
and fondling his dog, he instinctively feels that this
boy is not a stranger living in a far-away land and
speaking a foreign language, but that he represents
all the orphaned children in the world, and that his
affection for his dog is the same tie that binds every
other child to the pet he loves. So too with Monarch,
the majestic captive of Golden Gate Park. He is not
just a bear, a creature larger and more ferocious
than many other animals. He typifies wild life caged,
and the boy who has pitied him in listening to the
account of his tramp, tramp, tramp about the pit,
never quite forgets that proud but eternal unrest,
the ever present longing for the white peaks and the
pines.</p>

<p>One need not fear that putting these stories into
simple language may be deemed a sacrilegious act,
or that telling the plot of a masterpiece will kill
delight in that masterpiece itself. Goethe’s mother,
sitting in the firelight in their home, gave her boy
tales from the old poets, creating in him a desire
to read that helped to make him a profound student
and master thinker. And the twentieth-century child
will doubly enjoy reading a beautiful piece of literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at some future day, because in the magical
long ago it touched his heart. Workers with little
children should be ever on the alert, seeking stories
that deserve the name of literature, with plot and
characters that will appeal to their small charges,
because such stories mold a child’s taste and give
a key that will unlock doors into the great treasure
house of art. Whenever the mother or teacher or
librarian reads a story that is a literary gem, let
her analyze it and determine whether or not, if told
in simple language, it would delight a child. The old-time
narrators who molded national taste and ideals
did this constantly, and the great story-tellers are
doing it today.</p>

<p>Sicilian peasants, for instance, have a knowledge of
the classics that amazes the average American. The
stories are pictured on the market carts, those gaudy
conveyances that brighten the island highways from
Catania to Palermo, and the conversation of these
simple folk is colored with allusions that would do
credit to a professor of literature. Most of them cannot
read, but they know the plots of <i>Jerusalem
Delivered</i>, “Sindbad the Sailor,” “The Merchant of
Bagdad,” and many more of the world’s great stories.
They heard the tales in childhood, and their fathers
before them heard them from the lips of men who loved
to tell them, and so they have become a national
heritage. Let us do as much for the children of our
land, that the men and women of the future may
have a noble culture and more splendid possessions
than their parents have, and let us do it in the world-old
way, by story-telling.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Story Interests of Childhood</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>

<h4>B. IMAGINATIVE PERIOD</h4>

<p>When the child leaves the rhythmic, realistic period
he enters a world of make-believe and no longer
desires tales and jingles that are nothing more than a
recounting of facts he already knows. He delights in playing
he is some one other than himself, in pretending he is
doing things beyond the range of his possibilities, and
because he craves a larger experience he craves also
fanciful, imaginative tales in which he may have those
experiences. He knows that bees sting, that the dog
has a cold, wet nose, that the cat lands on its feet, and
the squirrel holds its tail up. He wonders about these
things, but he is still too limited in experience and in
mental capacity to give them real theoretical meaning.
Consequently he enjoys the wonder tale, or, as some
authorities term it, the “primitive-why story.” Early
racial tales are those of forest and plain, varying according
to the locality in which they originated, from the lion
and tiger stories of India and Central Africa to the
kangaroo fables of the Australian aborigine.</p>

<p>Primitive man through fear and fancy personified the
forces of nature and gave them human attributes, and
because they were less tangible than the creatures of
jungle and plain that figured in his earliest fables, his
mind visioned them as fantastic beings, sometimes
lovely and sometimes grotesque, fairies and goblins, destructive
monsters and demons, and avenging giants who
preserved him from that which he feared. Thus originated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the fairy story that was the expression of his
religion. The child enjoys these tales.</p>

<p>The narrator can gather this material with comparative
ease, because the science of ethnology has brought
to light many of these tales from primitive literature,
and not a few of them have been put into collections
available to child workers.</p>

<p>The fairy tale that grew out of the life of the race is
also rich in material for children of this period. By
“fairy tale” is meant that type of story usually associated
with the names of Grimm, Perrault, and Bechstein.
Little people delight in it, and will listen to it
again and again. Yet because of lack of understanding
on the part of parents and teachers, the fairy story
often proves to be the rock upon which the child craft
meets disaster. Because these tales have had a mighty
place in the history of the race and still have their work
in the education of the child, it does not follow that they
should be fed to young listeners as so much unassorted
grain is fed to chickens. There are many that should
not be used at all. Those that are used should be carefully
graded, because a child will enjoy a narrative in
which children are heroes, long before he enjoys one in
which adults hold the center of the stage. The father
and mother, brothers, sisters, uncles, cousins, and
aunts mean much to him because they are part of his
experience. But he does not know officers of the state
and nation. He does not know lawmakers and magistrates
and judges, and tales in which they have a part
are less interesting to him than those whose characters
are familiar personages. For instance, he is charmed
by “Little Red Hen” or “The Three Bears” at an age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
when “Beauty and the Beast” or “Sleeping Beauty”
mean little to him, and a good rule to guide the story-teller
in the grading of fairy tales is the well-known
pedagogical one, “Proceed from the known to the unknown,
from the simple to the complex.” Give first
those stories whose heroes are familiar personages, then
introduce those with characters not so well known.</p>

<p>The mention of fairy tales in education often raises
the question, “Is there not danger of making liars of
children by feeding them on these stories?” It seems
to me the best answer is given by Georg Ebers, the
Egyptologist and novelist, in his fascinating autobiography,
<i>The Story of My Life</i>. Out of his own experience,
he handles the subject of fairy tales sincerely
and convincingly, and his words are worthy of consideration
by every child worker.</p>

<p>“When the time for rising came,” he says, “I climbed
joyfully into my mother’s warm bed, and never did I
listen to more beautiful fairy tales than at those hours.
They became instinct with life to me and have always
remained so. How real became the distress of persecuted
innocence, the terrors and charm of the forest, the
joys and splendors of the fairy realm! If the flowers
in the garden had raised their voices in song, if the birds
on the boughs had called and spoken to me, nay, if a
tree had changed into a beautiful fairy or the toad in
the damp path of our shaded avenue into a witch, it
would have been only natural.</p>

<p>“It is a singular thing that actual events which happened
in those early days have largely vanished from
my memory, but the fairy tales I heard and secretly
experienced became firmly impressed on my mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Education and life provided for my familiarity with
reality in all its harshness and angles, its strains and
hurts, but who, in those later years, could have flung
wide the gates of the kingdom where everything is
beautiful and good, and where ugliness is as surely
doomed to destruction as evil to punishment? Therefore
I plead with voice and pen in behalf of fairy tales.
Therefore I give them to my children and grandchildren
and have even written a volume of them myself.</p>

<p>“All sensible mothers will doubtless, like ours, take
care that the children do not believe the stories which
they tell them to be true. I do not remember any time
when, if my mind had been called upon to decide, I
should have thought anything I invented myself really
happened; but I know that we were often unable to
distinguish whether the plausible tale invented by some
one else belonged to the realm of fact or fiction. On
such occasions we appealed to my mother, and her
answer instantly set all doubts at rest, for we thought
she could never be mistaken and knew that she always
told the truth.</p>

<p>“As to the stories I invented myself, I fared like other
imaginative children. I could imagine the most marvelous
things about every member of the household,
and while telling them, but only during that time, I
often fancied they were true. Yet the moment I was
asked whether these things had actually occurred, it
seemed that I woke from a dream. I at once separated
what I imagined from what I actually experienced, and
it never would have occurred to me to persist against
my better knowledge. So the vividly awakened
power of imagination led neither me, my brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and sisters, nor my children and grandchildren into
falsehood.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ebers’ words are based on sound psychology.
The child’s imaginative nature should be developed,
but there should never be any doubt in his mind as to
what is make-believe and what is real. Let him wander
at will through every realm of fancy, along its sun-kissed
highways, among its shadowy glens and wild cascades,
but let him realize it is a world of make-believe, not of
fact, which he inhabits during that period. His imagination
will be as much aroused, his emotional nature
will be stirred as deeply, and there will be no discovery
later that his mother or teacher deceived him, no temptation
to present as fact what he knows to be purely
fancy, which is a certain step toward the field of falsehood.
If he questions whether a fairy story is true or
not, tell him, “No, but once upon a time people thought
it was true,” and picture how the early tribesmen sat
around the fire at night listening to tales told by some
of their wise men, just as Indians and Eskimos do to
this day. It will make him sympathetic toward the
struggles of his remote forefathers, and he will not
think the narrator tried to dupe him, nor will he
regard the narrative itself as a silly yarn. It will be a
dignified tale to him because it was believed in the long
ago.</p>

<p>Since we can give only according to the measure in
which we possess, whoever tells fairy stories to children
ought to know something of their history and meaning.
He should have some understanding of how they have
come from the depths of the past to their present form,
some idea of the work of notable collectors, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
insight into the fundamental principles of the science
of folklore.</p>

<p>There are several theories about the origin of these
tales, the first and oldest being that they are sun myths
and can be traced back to the Vedas, and the exponents
of this belief offer many arguments to prove the truth of
their contention. The similarity of tales found among
people of widely separated regions, they claim, is evidence
that they must have come from a common source.
“Little Half-Chick,” a Spanish folk tale, is found in
slightly different dress among the Kabyles of Africa;
“Cinderella,” in some form or other, is common to every
country of Europe and to several oriental lands; while
the Teutonic tale of “Brier Rose” and the French of
“Sleeping Beauty” are modifications of the same <i>conte</i>.
Therefore, the orientalists contend, they must have come
from a common source and have been modified to suit
conditions of life in lands to which they were carried.</p>

<p>Another theory is that all European fairy tales are
remnants of the old mythology of the north, the nucleus
of the stories having been carried abroad by the Vikings,
while still another theory, the most notable advocate
of which was the late Andrew Lang, traces fairy tales
to the practices and customs of early man and a totemistic
belief in man’s descent from animals.</p>

<p>Then there are those also who contend that fairy tales
are primitive man’s philosophy of nature, his explanation
of the working of forces he did not understand.
The adherents of this theory admit the similarity of
tales found among different tribes, but claim that the
incidents, which are few, and the characters, who are
types, might occur anywhere. In the French story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of “Blue Beard” and the Greek tale of “Psyche” curiosity
leads to destruction—in the one case of life, in
the other of happiness. In the French “Diamonds and
Toads,” the Teutonic “Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs,” and the Bohemian “The Twelve Months,”
selfishness brings punishment and kindness reward,
while the cruel stepmother, the good prince, and the
fairy godmother are common to tales of every nation.</p>

<p>But however authorities disagree as to the origin
of these stories, they unite in declaring them to be one
of the oldest forms of literature. The first collection of
fairy tales of which we have any record was published
in Venice in 1550 by Straparola, and was a translation
of stories from oriental sources. From Italian the book
was done into French and, for those early days when
books were rare and costly, had a wide circulation. For
almost a century this was the only collection of fairy
tales in existence. Then, in 1637, a book was published
in Naples, <i>Il Pentamerone</i>, which Keightley declares is
the best collection of fairy tales ever written. The
stories were told in the Neapolitan dialect and were
drawn from Sicily, Candia, and Italy proper, where
Giambattista Basile had gathered them from the people
during years of wandering.</p>

<p>About sixty years later, in a magazine published at
The Hague, appeared a story, “La Belle au Bois Dormant,”
by Charles Perrault, which was none other than
the tale we know as “Sleeping Beauty.” It did not
originate with Perrault, but had been told him in childhood
by his nurse, who was a peasant from Picardy.
A year later seven other stories appeared, “Red Riding
Hood,” “Blue Beard,” “Puss in Boots,” “The Fairy,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
“Cinderella,” “Riquet o’ the Tuft,” and “Hop o’ My
Thumb.” They were published under the title, <i>Contes
du Temps Passé avec Moralités</i>, and signed, “P. Darmancour.”
Darmancour was a stepson of Perrault,
and wrote them at the older man’s request from the
nurse’s tales; so they live in literature as Perrault’s
work. After this French collector came the German
scholars, the Grimms, who gathered and preserved
the folklore of the Thuringian peasants; Goethe, the
Sage of Weimar; Madame Villeneuve; Ruskin; Andrew
Lang; and several others. Each of these added
to the work begun by Straparola and Basile, until now
we have tales from almost every nation, tales proving
that a belief in the supernatural is common to primitive
people in every clime.</p>

<p>Another aspect wonderfully interesting in the study of
fairy tales is the distinctive features of those of different
regions, which are so marked that they can be classified
according to the locality and topography of the region
in which they originated. The largest number of these
supernatural beliefs is found among nations whose scenery
is wild and rugged, where there are mountains,
morasses, dangerous cataracts, and tempestuous oceans,
while in flat, cultivated countries away from the sea the
fairy superstition is not so strong and the tales are
less fantastic. This fact argues powerfully in favor of
the Aryan theory that they are primitive man’s philosophy
of nature, the expression of his religion, and some
educators claim that as they were religious stories to the
race, they still are religious to the child.</p>

<p>Whether this theory is accepted or refuted, there can
be no doubt in the mind of a thinking person that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fairy tales are given to children they should be given
intelligently and with discrimination. The narrator
should exercise care in their selection, and have some
fixed principles to govern that selection, because of the
quantity and doubtful literary and ethical quality of
much juvenile material.</p>

<p>Many modern fairy stories are not fit to give to children.
In selecting fanciful tales for this period of
childhood, choose first of all the old ones, those that
originated in the childhood of the race, the stories of
Grimm, Perrault, and Bechstein. They have stood
the test of the ages. They are expressed in beautiful
language, they create ideals and arouse inspiration,
they feed and satisfy.</p>

<p>There are some fairy tales of later origin that are the
works of great writers and deserve the name of literature.
First on this list come those of Hans Christian Andersen.
“The Three Bears” of Robert Southey is another good
example, and sometimes we find floating through magazines
and in books of recent issue, fairy tales that are
excellent ones to give to children, because they have
all the elements of the racial tales. Notable among
these is “The Wonder Box” by Will Bradley. But,
if there be any doubt in the mind of the narrator
about the merit of modern stories, he had better eliminate
them from his list and use only those that have
stood the test of the ages.</p>

<p>However, even among racial tales the narrator will
come upon pitfalls unless judgment mark his selection.
The conditions governing his struggle for existence
gave primitive man a harsh standard, and consequently
his literature is often tinged with a vindictive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
spirit wholly out of keeping with the ideals of today.
Stories in which cruelty, revenge, and bloodshed have
a large part should never be told to the young child, no
matter what their age or origin. “Blue Beard” is a
good example. Although itself a classic, and a recital
of the deeds of a French ruler whose name is a synonym
of infamy, this tale and all similar tales should
be tabooed from the world of little people.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens was the first man in England whose
voice carried weight to plead for fairy tales as a part
of the school curriculum, and within a few years Dickens
found it necessary to oppose the usage of stories that
were corrupting the children of the British Isles. Because
they were urged to tell fairy tales, unthinking
teachers told any that they found, even those in which
all the savagery of early man was portrayed. Accounts
of beheadings and man-eatings became part of the
daily program, and many acts of cruelty among children
were traceable to these stories. Instead of teaching
forbearance, courtesy, consideration of the poor and
aged, and abhorrence of brute force, which the wisely
chosen fairy tale will do, story-telling was turning the
children into young savages. If the dominant element
in a story is cruelty, strike that tale from the list;
for even though the deed be punished in the end, the
fact that the attention of an unkind child is focused upon
cruel acts often leads him to experiment and see what
will happen. And I plead also for the elimination from
the story-teller’s list of every tale in which an unkind
or drunken parent plays a part, even though the tale
itself be a literary gem. The father or mother is the
child’s ideal, and it is not the mission of the narrator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to shatter that ideal. Even if little folk have discovered
that there are delinquent parents in the world,
it is a mental shock to have that fact emphasized, and
the story that shocks in any way had better be left untold.</p>

<p>Sometimes the elimination or modification of a cruel
feature of a tale makes it suitable for telling to children,
as in “Hansel and Gretel.” The ending Humperdinck
uses in his opera, wherein the old witch turns to gingerbread
instead of being baked in the oven by the orphans,
is far better ethically than the original one, yet the elemental
part of the story is left unspoiled. Narrators
cannot be too careful in this respect; for the function
of story-telling is to refine rather than to brutalize, to
give pleasure and not to shock, and there is no excuse
for using tales that corrupt or injure in any way when
there are enough lovely ones to satisfy every normal
desire of the child. Let the test of selection be the question,
Does this story contain an element or picture that
will shock a sensitive child or whet the cruel tendencies
of a rough, revengeful one? If it does, do not use it
even though the list of fairy tales may be reduced to
a very limited one, but choose the other material for
this period from the lore of science that will feed the
fancy and not warp the soul or distort the character.

Interest in Nature Study.”)</p>

<span class="smcap">The Story Interests of Childhood</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>

<h4>C. HEROIC PERIOD</h4>

<p>When the child leaves the imaginative period, he
enters another realm of realism. The fairy
world is no longer a place of enchantment to him. He
is now in a condition corresponding to that of primitive
man when he was not satisfied to sit by the tribal fire and
listen to stories about creatures who personified the
elements, but fared forth on the path of adventure, eager
to know what lay beyond the lodge place of his people,
feverish with desire to conquer and remove whatever
obstructed his way. The barbaric, fighting instinct
manifests itself, and in many children a destructive
curiosity is apparent. They long to repeat the experiences
of their ancestors in this same period. They
want to live through nights of danger and days of daring,
and since the juvenile court and probation officers
hover Argus-eyed about them, ready to swoop down
upon every lad who would go pirating or pathfinding,
the nearest approach to the experience consists in listening
to and in reading tales of adventure. This age
is usually from about eight to twelve, although there
are no tightly drawn lines of demarcation. Individual
cases differ, and some children of ten are still delighted
by fairy tales, while other lads of seven are well into the
heroic period. Broadly speaking, however, this period
begins about the age of eight.</p>

<p>There is no time in the child life during which the
story-teller has a finer opportunity of sowing seeds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
shall come into splendid fruition by and by than in the
heroic period, and because parents and teachers do
not realize this fact clearly enough, boys read stories
whose tendency is to brutalize and lead them into
trouble. It does not follow, because they are drawn
as steel to steel to such literature, that the boys are depraved.
They crave action, danger, daring. It is a
cry of nature that cannot be silenced, and because the
hunger is not satisfied in a wholesome way, they go
where they can find the food they must have, for
numerous doors are open to them.</p>

<p>Dozens of writers are doing pernicious work for the
youth of the country by pouring forth a flood of
adventure stories, perhaps not with malicious intent,
but with the little knowledge that often brings dire
results. Knowing the demand for the heroic, they
write yarns whose only claim to recognition is a clever,
spectacular plot. These books embody no ideals, and
the aspirations they arouse had better be left to slumber.
Sometimes, as a result of such reading, boys run
away from home to fight Indians or turn pirate, and
many a lad has begun a career of lawlessness ending
in crime, who with a little direction might have been an
individual of value to the world. Such cases are so
common that they have come under the notice of almost
every child worker, and the pity of it is that literature
is rich in tales that satisfy the adventure craving, yet
arouse high ideals and inspire to worth-while deeds.
Instead of originating in the brain of some modern
craftsman who is actuated by a desire for money-making,
they grew out of the life of the race and
perpetuate the noblest traditions of the race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Human nature is much the same in all climes and in
all ages. Until man reaches a very high state of enlightenment
he is more thrilled by manifestations of
physical bravery than by mental and moral courage,
and he who possesses muscular strength is the hero in
his eyes. A Hercules or Samson is mightier to him than
a Savonarola facing persecution with sublime tenacity
of purpose and dying steadfast to his ideal, because
he can understand the brute strength of the one, while
the spiritual fortitude of the other is beyond his comprehension.
He is thrilled by action, physical action, and
he craves and will have literature every page of which is
colored by feats of prowess.</p>

<p>It is useless to try to substitute something else for
children in this period. When we hunger for bread
and meat, after-dinner mints will not satisfy, even
though they be very delectable confections. This
ravenous appetite of boys and girls must be satisfied,
and if they are to grow into well-balanced men and
women we must feed it with wholesome food instead
of allowing them to roam unguided and eat of that which
poisons.</p>

<p>There is no finer adventure tale in any literature than
that of Robin Hood, none more satisfying to children
in the early heroic period. This statement often brings
a cry of remonstrance, and the objection is made that
there is danger in portraying an outlaw as a hero, or in
picturing the allurement of a brigandish career. But
Robin Hood an outlaw? He lived in an age of injustice
when might made right. The man of the people was
but the chattel of a king, with no rights his lord was
bound to respect. Bold Robin, in the depths of Sherwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Forest, devoted his life to redressing wrongs. He
took from the oppressor and gave to the oppressed.
He strove to stamp out injustice and tyranny, and
his spirit is the foundation of the democracy that
underlies every just government today. He was an
outlaw, not because he was a criminal, but because he
rebelled against the monstrous injustice of his age and
strove to ameliorate the condition of the poor and
downtrodden. In the time of Henry the Second he
was hunted like a deer, but in the twentieth century he
would be honored as a great reformer.</p>

<p>Robin’s sense of justice appeals to boys and girls,
and his fearlessness and kindliness awaken their admiration.
They respond sympathetically to the story from
the opening chapter, when he enters the forest and
Little John joins his band, through the closing one where
the hero of the greenwood goes to his final rest. If
the tale is told with emphasis upon the true spirit of
Robin Hood instead of with a half apology, it will prove
wholesome food for the children and will help to make
them juster, kinder, and more democratic men and
women.</p>

<p>The national epics are splendid sources of story material
for children in the heroic period, especially those
originating in Teutonic lands and those formalized
among nations not yet in a high state of civilization.
Their characters are elemental, and their incidents
appeal to boys and girls. Some of the stories of King
Arthur and his knights, of Beowulf, of Sigurd the
Volsung, of Frithjof, of Pwyll, hero of the Welsh
Mabinogion, as well as many from the Nibelungenlied,
the Iliad, and the Odyssey, can also be used with excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
results. Naturally the tales of an elemental type
should be chosen first rather than those that are more
highly refined and poetic. It has been my experience
that the Mabinogion is enjoyed before the Arthuriad.
Boys, especially, delight in hearing of Pwyll, lord of the
Seven Countries of Dyved, and the adventures that
befell him as he hunted in the forests of his dominions.
These stories are of very ancient origin and are simple,
strong, and dramatic. They were sung by harpers
(mabinogs) in the castle halls of Wales, and finally were
gathered into the Mabinogion, which was done into
English by Lady Charlotte Gest. The story-teller
will find <i>The Boy’s Mabinogion</i>, by Sidney Lanier, an
excellent handbook for this period, as it embodies the
most desirable of this ancient Gaelic material, and is
put into modern form by an artist.</p>

<p>Follow the Mabinogion with the less poetic of the
King Arthur stories. The account of how Arthur
won his sword and became king, of Percival and the Red
Knight, and of Arthur fighting the giant mean more to
the ten-year-old than does Sir Galahad and the Holy
Grail. The Greek myths too should be drawn from
during this period—not the highly poetic, finished
tales of the Hellenes, but the elemental ones whose
heroes are rugged characters that awaken child admiration.
Hercules, Perseus, Achilles, and several other
demigods vie for honors with King Arthur and Beowulf
in the mind of the fourth-grade boy, and the story-teller
should not fail to draw from the rich field of
southern literature as well as from that of the north.
But let her exercise care in selection and keep to the
realm of heroism instead of entering that of romance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Such stories as “Cupid and Psyche,” “Pygmalion and
Galatea,” and “Apollo and Daphne” mean little to
boys and girls of ten, yet teachers and librarians often
use them and wonder why their audiences respond
with so little enthusiasm. There are those who contend
that all the epical stories should be given in
simplified form during this period, but why spoil the
romantic, poetic ones which are so much more enjoyed
a little later and so much better understood, when
there are hundreds that can be given without pruning
them to the heart? Certain investigations and statistics
show that the telling of the highly refined Greek
myths to boys and girls in the early heroic period gives
an erroneous idea of Greek standards, and dulls an interest
in mythology later on. The story-teller should
bear this fact in mind, and remember that literature
rich in symbolism and formulated among people refined
to a degree of æstheticism is not the literature to give
to adventure-craving children, no matter to what simple
language it may be reduced.</p>

<p>Splendidly dramatic is the tale of Roland and Oliver,
which every boy loves, of Ogier the Dane, and of some
of the other heroes of the time of Charlemagne. Children
listen spellbound to the account of the first meeting
and disagreement of the two lads whose friendship
makes such a sweet and colorful story, and of Charles
the Great in council with his peers and knights, and
delight in the swinging lines of the old ballad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The emperor sits in an orchard wide,</div>
<div class="verse">Roland and Oliver by his side:</div>
<div class="verse">With them many a gallant lance,</div>
<div class="verse">Full fifteen thousand of gentle France.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Upon a throne of beaten gold</div>
<div class="verse">The lord of ample France behold:</div>
<div class="verse">White his hair and beard were seen,</div>
<div class="verse">Fair of body and proud of mien.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The story of Bayard is an admirable one for this
period, as well as that of the Spanish hero, the Cid;
and “St. George and the Dragon” is always a favorite.</p>

<p>I plead, too, that more of the narrator’s time be devoted
to the telling of our own American epic of <i>Hiawatha</i>.
The answer comes, “That is read in school.”
To be sure it is, and one reason why it is read so badly
and appreciated so little is that it was not given in story
form first. The German child uses the Nibelungenlied
as a classroom text, but before he studies the epic he
knows its tales. Gunther, Hagen, Siegfried, and
Dankwart are familiar characters to him, and consequently
he enjoys the poem.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to <i>Hiawatha</i>. If boys and
girls are acquainted with Hiawatha himself, if they
know Nokomis and Chibiabos and Kwasind and Iagoo
before they are given the poem to study, it means something
to them that it cannot mean otherwise. Perhaps
one reason why Longfellow’s masterpiece has been so
little used by story-tellers is that the work of putting
it into story form is a task with which the non-professional
is unable to cope. Now, however, an excellent
retold work is on the market—Winston’s <i>Story of
Hiawatha</i>—which makes it possible for every narrator
to have her children know the American epic as well as
German young people know the Nibelungenlied.</p>

<p>In considering stories for the heroic period of childhood,
let us not forget the biographical and historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
narratives that fulfill every requirement of hero tales.
Boys and girls love the epical stories because they are
true in spirit, but they love also those that are true in
fact. It is a mistake to think that biography is dull and
uninteresting to them, because stories of the boyhood
of great men, great rulers, great discoverers and path-finders,
great lawgivers, painters, musicians, and writers,
are hero tales of the highest type. Many of them have
been told admirably for young people, and the narrator
does no more valuable work than when he uses them
freely. Sir Walter Raleigh, De Soto, Coronado, Frederick
the Great, Napoleon, Garibaldi, Solyman the
Magnificent, Robert the Bruce, Kosciusko, William
Wallace, William Tell, and dozens of others are as
fascinating as Beowulf or Hercules and have an influence
even more powerful, because children know that
these heroes have actually lived. Never mind what
some authorities say about the man of Switzerland being
a mythical personage. Let American young people
know him as those of the Alpine land know him, as the
defender of his ancient rights and native mountains,
the embodiment of the spirit of Helvetia. They will
be finer men and women because of it, and that, more
than anything else, concerns the story-teller.</p>

<p>Then, too, there are history tales, hundreds of them,
from every age and every land. There are brave deeds
done by children that every child should know. The
little girl on the St. Lawrence, holding the blockhouse
of Vercheres against the Iroquois, the boy whose courage
and presence of mind saved Lucerne, the event
through which William of Orange came to be known as
William the Silent, and many other similar narratives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
are intensely interesting to boys and girls. Some of
the Old Testament tales belong in this period; for a
detailed account of them see <a href="#CHAPTER_TWELVE">Chapter Twelve</a>, on “Bible
Stories.”</p>

<p>At this age, when the adventure spirit runs high,
when pathfinding and Indian fighting are desired above
all other things, how are we to keep boys and girls from
running away to lead such lives themselves? One
way is by letting them live the lives of the heroes who
thrill them—in other words, by dramatizing. It is
the hunger for experience that causes boys to turn vagabond,
and juvenile-court records show that many of the
ten- and twelve-year-olds who are lured by the call of
adventure come from homes that offer nothing to feed
the adventure craving, whereas those who have some of
the desired experiences at home are less likely to start
out seeking them. It is a wise mother who encourages
her boys to make pirate caves in their own back yards,
to be youthful Crusoes, Kit Carsons, Daniel Boones,
and Robin Hoods for a Saturday morning, and the
school or public playground that provides for much out-of-door
acting is doing something that will prevent
many evils. In some children this desire is so strong
that it is almost a fever, and if not satisfied in a wholesome
manner is likely to lead to lamentable ends. I
remember how much it meant to me in my own childhood,
when I burned to lead the lives of some of the
heroes of whom I had read or heard, to be permitted to
participate in the Indian warfare of the neighborhood
boys and be the maiden who was carried away into
captivity. It was such a blissful experience that I joyfully
contributed my small allowance to buy red ink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
for war paint and to help costume the braves, and when
a Sioux band came to town, I ecstatically trudged after
the wagon and lived for a day in a realm far removed
from my accustomed one. The boys had feeling to
even a greater degree, and who knows but that without
this Indian play some of them might have gone forth in
search of adventure and become criminals, whereas
every one is now a law-abiding, useful citizen.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Story Interests of Childhood</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>

<h4>D. ROMANTIC PERIOD</h4>

<p>At about the age of twelve or thirteen the child’s
rougher instincts begin to soften. Romance and
sentiment develop. He becomes particular about
his appearance. It is less of a task than formerly to
get the boy to wash his face and hands, and he has
not the antipathy toward civilized attire that he had
in the days when Robinson Crusoe was the hero.
Instead, he manifests a liking for being dressed according
to prevailing modes, sometimes changing so suddenly
from a dirty cave dweller into a dandy that it
is like the metamorphosis from grub to butterfly. He
craves socks and ties of bright colors and clothes that
attract attention. If fashion prescribes peg-topped
or straight, spare trousers, he wants them extremely
wide or extremely narrow, and is willing to have his
chin sawed unmercifully if high collars are the vogue,
not because of a fit of hysteria, but because he has
entered the period when sex awakens. He is becoming
interested in the girls and wishes to be dressed in
a manner that will cause them to be interested in him;
and very often his taste for literature changes as completely
as his personal habits. He desires stories of
a higher type of heroism than those he craved in an
earlier period, stories of romance and chivalry, and
now is the time to give him the epic in its entirety,
because of the deep racial emotions therein expressed.</p>

<p>He has had many of the adventure tales from the
epics during the earlier period. Now he is ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
those tinged with romance, those pervaded by a spirit
of fiery idealism in which knights risk limb and life
in loyalty to principle, for fealty to king, or in defense
of some fair lady. Percival seeking the Grail is a finer
hero to him than Percival battling with the Red Knight,
and the vow of the men of the Round Table means
something because he can understand it. In a vague,
indefinite way romance is touching his own life, and
his noblest emotions are awakened by the noble words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">To reverence the king, as if he were</div>
<div class="verse">Their conscience, and their conscience as their king,</div>
<div class="verse">To break the heathen and uphold the Christ,</div>
<div class="verse">To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,</div>
<div class="verse">To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,</div>
<div class="verse">To honor his own word as if his God’s,</div>
<div class="verse">To lead sweet lives in purest chastity,</div>
<div class="verse">To love one maiden only, cleave to her,</div>
<div class="verse">And worship her by years of noble deeds.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Boys and girls in the heroic period enjoyed only
the Arthurian stories that glorify physical bravery,
those of jousting and conflict into which women do
not enter. But now they delight in such tales as those
of Geraint and Enid, of Launcelot and Elaine, and
some of the adventures of Tristram.</p>

<p>Here a word of caution is necessary. Like the Old
Testament stories, these romantic tales will arouse
the noblest emotions and highest ideals if given with
wisdom, but if told thoughtlessly may create an almost
morbid desire for the vulgar. Therefore the non-professional
narrator should use for his work some retold
version of the King Arthur tales instead of adapting
from <i>Le Morte d’Arthur</i>, because there is much in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
original that should be eliminated in presenting it to
those in the adolescent period. The Pyle or Radford
editions are excellent, likewise <i>The Boy’s King Arthur</i>,
by Sidney Lanier, each of which keeps the spirit of
the poem, but omits everything objectionable.</p>

<p>The story of King Arthur, embracing as it does the
Grail legend, should be followed by the German tale
of “Parsifal,”—not the Wagner opera version, but
the original medieval legend, “The Knightly Song of
Songs” of Wolfram von Eschenbach. This has been
retold beautifully by Anna Alice Chapin in <i>The Story
of Parsifal</i>, a book with which every child in the romantic
period should be familiar. Miss Guerber, in
her <i>Legends of the Middle Ages</i>, relates the tale of
Titurel and the Holy Grail, which will be helpful to
the narrator because of the light it throws on the origin
of the legend. But for a telling version there is none
equal to that of Miss Chapin, none in which the lofty
chivalric spirit of the medieval poem is portrayed so
faithfully.</p>

<p>The romantic portion of all the national epics, as
well as that of <i>Le Morte d’Arthur</i>, is excellent material
for the story-teller in the early adolescent period.
The Nibelungenlied, the Iliad, the Odyssey, and parts
of <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i> feed boys and girls in the early
teens as pure adventure stories fed them a year or two
before. And if the narrator would have his young
listeners enjoy the epical tales to the uttermost, let
him quote freely from the epic itself as he tells them.
During this age, when romance and sentiment run
high and life is beheld through a rainbow-hued glamour,
poetry is a serious and beautiful thing. The frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
interpolation of it into a story heightens the pleasure
in that story, and young people listen with the gleaming
eyes of intense feeling to words like these of Siegfried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ever,” said he, “your brethren I’ll serve as best I may,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor once while I have being, will head on pillow lay,</div>
<div class="verse">Till I have done to please them whate’er they bid me do;</div>
<div class="verse">And this, my Lady Kriemhild, is all for love of you.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, young people should understand that
the epics were first given to the race in poetic form, and
in leading them to that knowledge we can lead them
also to an appreciation of the majestic, sweeping measures
of the Iliad or Odyssey or Nibelungenlied, which
is in itself worth thought and labor on the part of the
story-teller.</p>

<p>The Langobardian myths, Dietrich von Bern, the
story of Gudrun, of Charlemagne and Frastrada and
Huon of Bordeaux, are intensely interesting in this
period. Joan of Arc never fails to charm, while tales
of the minnesingers, the troubadours, and the Crusaders
open gates into lands of enchantment.</p>

<p>Oh, the romance in the lives of these medieval wanderers!
Walther von der Vogelweide, too poor to
buy him a coat, yet swaying the thought of the German
lands; Bernard of Ventadour, among the flaming
roses of Provence, making music at the court of Eleanor
of Aquitaine; Richard Cœur de Lion, riding with a
singing heart toward Palestine; De Coucy, Frederick
Barbarossa, and scores of others who lived and achieved
in that distant, colorful time! Their lives are gleaming
pages in the history of their age, and their stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
are glorious ones to give to boys and girls who crave
the romantic.</p>

<p>Wonderful, too, is the account of the Children’s
Crusade, of Stephen, a happy shepherd on the hills
of Cloyes, and that other lad of Cologne, who, fired
with desire to restore to the Christian world places
the Moslem had defiled, sailed away with their followers
to shipwreck and slavery. In connection with this
tale the children should hear, if possible, some of the
music from Gabriel Pierne’s great cantata, <i>The Children’s
Crusade</i>. It will give them a clearer, more vivid
idea of the preaching of the boy apostle, of the gathering
of the company, of the pilgrimage along the Rhine
and Seine, of their rejoicing upon reaching the port of
Marseilles, and of the light of noble purpose that
glorified their eyes as they went singing to the ships.
Perhaps historians have proved the account of this
crusade to be just a myth. Tell it anyway, for whether
it be fact or fiction the tale is too lovely for young folk
to miss.</p>

<p>There is another type of biographical story, that of
the man and woman of moral courage whose life was
not so chromatically picturesque as that of him who
fought the Saracens or sang in old Provence, but nevertheless
thrills, fascinates, and influences. Florence
Nightingale is a good example. Beautiful, the daughter
of rich and distinguished parents, she might have
reigned a social queen in England; yet she spent her
young womanhood studying how to alleviate human
suffering, toiling under the burning sun of the East,
battling with disease at the risk of health and life, and
well deserving the title given her by those she comforted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
“The Angel of the Crimea.” I have seen girls
of sixteen listen with tears in their eyes to the story
of this noble Englishwoman, and have watched the
throats of boys throb and pulsate upon hearing the
account of the British Army and Navy banquet at
which the question was asked, “Who, of all the workers
in the Crimea, will be remembered longest?” and every
voice replied in refrain, “Florence Nightingale!”
Several years ago a questionnaire, distributed at a
convention of nurses, revealed the fact that ten per
cent of those there had been influenced toward their
life career by the story of this great English nurse.
Yet there are dubious souls who wonder if story-telling
pays! If the narrator can have only a few books
from which to draw material for the romantic period,
Laura E. Richards’ <i>Life of Florence Nightingale</i> ought
to be one of the number. It is sympathetically and
beautifully told, an artist’s tribute to an immortal
woman.</p>

<p>Workers with youths in the adolescent period are
brought face to face with one of the gravest problems
educators have to solve. What is to be done about
lovesick boys and girls, those in whom the elemental
passions have awakened yet who have not the judgment
and self-control that age and experience bring? How
are we to keep them, in their first emotional upheaval,
from losing all sense of proportion and from pursuing
a course that may lead to disaster? The freedom given
in these days of coeducation, and the unrestricted circulation
of novels and stories dealing with the relations
of the sexes, which may be worthy creations from
the standpoint of art, but which distort the ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
unformed youth, make possible a condition that often
appalls parents and high-school teachers and sets
them to wondering how to meet it.</p>

<p>Ellen Key suggests a remedy. In this period when
the world-old emotions are first aroused, she advocates
the use of love stories that are pure in tone and high
in ideal. We cannot change human nature and keep
the boy of sixteen from being drawn as if by a magnet
to the maid who is lovely in his eyes, but we can give
him an ideal that will make his feeling an elevating
thing instead of a debasing one. We can put into the
heart of the girl a poetry and idealism that will keep
her worthy of the prince, and we can do it through
literature. Instead of leaving her free to roam unguided
and read whatever falls into her hand, or of
sitting like a board of censors beside her and goading
her toward the forbidden, which always allures, we
can lead her to delightful, wholesome stories, of which
there are a goodly number. This does not mean confining
her to writers of several generations ago. Present-day
youths know that almost every one reads
current books, and they intend to have them, too.
Therefore let the story-teller use the best of the new,
even as he uses the best of the old. Let him refer
frequently to it and tell enough of it to awaken such
an interest that it will be read. A good plan is for
the teacher of English to devote a few minutes each
week to the discussion of some recent book or books,
and to give lists of those that boys and girls will enjoy.
In public libraries slips should be posted, upon which
are named the most desirable of recent publications,
and problem novels should be excluded from shelves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to which the public has access. Thus our adolescent
children may be led to glean from the best of the new.
But meanwhile let us not neglect the old.</p>

<p>One of the lovely works with which to familiarize
high-school pupils is <i>Ekkehard</i>, by Joseph Victor von
Scheffel, which, aside from its value as a historical
novel, is one of the noblest love stories ever written.
It is a charming picture of life in the tenth century,
when the Hunnic hordes swept like a devastating
flame into the peaceful Bodensee region. Hadwig,
proud duchess of Suabia, Ekkehard, the dreaming,
handsome monk who goes from the monastery of St.
Gall to become Latin instructor at Castle Hohentwiel
and learns far more than he teaches, Praxedis, the
winsome Greek maid, Hadumoth the goose girl, and
the goat boy Audifax, all are fascinating, appealing
characters. From beginning to end the book is
intensely interesting, and as Nathan Haskell Dole
says, “full of undying beauty.”</p>

<p>Another charming work of a German writer is <i>Moni
the Goat Boy</i>, by Johanna Spyri. The novels of Eugénie
Marlitt are wholesome and well written, and give vivid
pictures of life in the smaller courts of Europe. Those
of Louisa Mühlbach portray in a remarkable manner
the lives of some of the notable figures of history, and
the intimate glimpses they give of such characters as
Frederick the Great, Schiller, Goethe, Marie Antoinette,
and Maria Theresa, with their reflection of the color
and ceremony of a bygone day, cause them to mean
in this period what adventure tales mean to boys and
girls of ten.</p>

<p>In drawing from Germany, let us not forget Georg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Ebers, who lifts the cloud of mystery that veils old
Egypt and permits us to share the romance, the loves,
the joys and sorrows of men and women of the Pharaohs’
time. His works are not dull inscriptions gathered
from sepulchers and mummies, but moving pictures
of living, breathing men and women, filmed
by the genius of a master; and the triumphs of the
Princess Bent-Anat, the sufferings of the captive
Uarda, and the spectacular victory of the royal charioteer
are so real that they seem to be in the here and
now instead of in the early morning of the world.</p>

<p>From France we may glean without limit. Georges
Ohnet, Jacques Vincent, Ludovic Halévy, and dozens
of other writers have produced works that are not only
a part of the education of every one who aspires to
become a cultured man or woman, but are as fascinating
as fairy tales to a child. Then there is the great
treasure house of English and American literature,
as rich in priceless things of pen and brain as the gallery
of the Vatican is rich in paintings and sculpture. Boys
and girls will not draw from this wealth unguided,
because they do not know where it is stored. But
if we give them frequent glimpses of its brightness, if
we half open the door of the repository and let them
peep inside, they will follow, seeking it, as the miner
follows the half-revealed ore vein, or as Ortnit of old
pursued the Fata Morgana. They need not drift
into pools that breed disease, when by enough story-telling
to awaken their interest in the beautiful and
fine they may sail into open streams where the water
is clear, and where there are no submerged reefs to
wreck their fragile crafts.</p>

<span class="smcap">Building the Story</span></h3>

<p>Story-telling is a creative art, and therefore
a knowledge of underlying principles is as
indispensable to the narrator as to the sculptor or
painter. Without this knowledge he cannot hope to
adapt material to his needs, but must be limited in
his choice to what is already in form to give to children;
with it he can avail himself of many opportunities
to bring to his charges treasures of which they could
know nothing but for his ability to dig them from the
profound tomes in which they are hidden, polish and
clarify them, and put them in a setting within the understanding
of the child. For this reason a course in
story-writing is a part of the training of the professional
story-teller, and while the mother or teacher cannot
make such extensive preparation, she may to advantage
master and apply a few cardinal principles of construction.</p>

<p>The beginning of the oral story should never be an
introduction, because from the first word the child
expects something to happen, and if nothing does
happen his attention scatters and interest is lost.
Therefore the narrator must bring his actors on the
stage and get them to work at once; he must not let
them stand around waiting while he gives a detailed
description of their hair and eyes and of the clothes
they wear, but must have them do something. It is
often necessary to make some explanatory remarks
in the beginning, but it should be done in such a way
that the hearer has no time to wonder when the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
is going to begin. For instance, if your tale is about
a boy in Holland, do not delay bringing the boy in
while you tell about the country. Let him enter at
the beginning, and then, by a sentence here and a
clause or phrase there, give the setting with the action.
The story must bristle with human interest; for while
the child knows nothing about the meaning of that
term, he nevertheless demands that something happen,
and if nothing does happen you lose his attention. The
written story may depend for its charm upon character
drawing and local color, but the oral story demands
<i>plot</i>, and if this plot is badly hung together the story
fails in its aim, for it does not make a deep impression.</p>

<p>The narrative style is better adapted to beginning
the oral story than dialogue, because it is more easily
handled by the novice. Of course the professional
story-teller is not restricted to one field, and genius
is privileged to range at large and ignore rules with no
dire results. But it is safe for the amateur to keep
to the narrative style. In the depths of dialogue, his
little craft may founder, but the much-loved words
“Once upon a time” or “Long, long ago” arrest the
attention immediately, even though the teller be not
an artist; and having made a good beginning, he is
reasonably sure of holding his hearers to the end.
On the other hand, if he does not get them at the start,
his story-telling time is apt to end in failure.</p>

<p>There are no set phrases or clauses with which one
must begin a story, and it would be a mistake to say
that dialogue can never be used safely in opening
the oral story, for the professional often uses it with
fine effect; but it is easier and safer for the amateur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to use the narrative beginning, and introduce dialogue
as the plot develops.</p>

<p>Dr. Berg Esenwein, whose excellent work, <i>Writing
the Short Story</i>, will be of value to the story-teller as
well as to the story-writer, lays down these rules:</p>

<p>“Do not strike one note in the beginning and another
in the body of the story.</p>

<p>“Do not touch anything that is not a live wire leading
direct to the heart of the story.</p>

<p>“Do not describe where you can suggest.”</p>

<p>An examination of some of the perfect stories of the
world shows that these rules hold good in every case.
The tales of Grimm, Andersen, Perrault, and Bechstein
are flawless in construction, and each plunges directly
into the thread of the story. Take, for instance, “The
Three Tasks” of Grimm:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There once lived a poor maiden who was young and fair,
but she had lost her own mother, and her stepmother did
all she could to make her miserable.</p>

</div>

<p>“The Pea Blossom,” of Hans Christian Andersen:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There were once five peas in a pod. They were green and
the pod was green, and they thought all the world was green.</p>

</div>

<p>“Red Riding Hood,” as written by Perrault, begins
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Once upon a time there lived in a small village in the country
a little girl, the prettiest, sweetest creature that ever was
seen. Her mother loved her fondly, and her grandmother
doted on her still more.</p>

</div>

<p>“The Twin Brothers” by Grimm:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There were once two brothers, one of whom was rich and
the other poor. The rich brother was a goldsmith and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a wicked heart. The poor brother supported himself by
making brooms, and was good and honest.</p>

</div>

<p>It is the same in Ruskin’s “King of the Golden
River,” in Robert Southey’s “Three Bears,” in all the
tales of De Maupassant that are suitable for telling,
and in those of Alphonse Daudet. Note the beginning
of Daudet’s “Last Lesson”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Little Franz did not want to go to school that morning.
He would much rather have played. The air was so warm
and still. You could hear the blackbirds singing at the edge
of the wood, and the sound of the Prussians drilling down by
the old sawmill.</p>

</div>

<p>Every one of these stories begins with narrative,
and every one is a perfect tale for telling.</p>

<p>Next in consideration comes the body of the story,
which our rhetoric teachers taught us is a succession
of events moving toward the climax. Until the climax
is reached the oral story must be full of suspense. In
other words, the hearer must be kept guessing about
what is going to happen. The child does not care
about a story in which he sees the end. He does enjoy
hearing the same story told over and over again if it
thrilled him at the first telling, because he likes to re-experience
that thrill. But if a new tale holds no suspense,
it falls flat. Stevenson says: “The one rule is
to be infinitely various—to interest, to disappoint, to
surprise, yet still to gratify. To be ever changing, as
it were, the stitch, yet still to give the effect of an ingenious
neatness.” In other words, the succession of
events must follow one another in a regular sequence, and
each must contribute something to the one following it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>As a rather homely illustration of the meaning of
this, we may say that plot centers around a hole, and
in a well-constructed story the steps by which the hero
gets into the hole are traced, and then those by which
he gets out. The getting out is the climax or, as Dr.
Barrett says, “the apex of interest and emotion.”
In other words, it is the top of a ladder, and the story
must move in an unbroken line toward that topmost
rung. If it does not do this, if the thread of the tale
is broken to interpolate something that should have been
told in the beginning, the narrator loses his audience.</p>

<p>The climax must be a surprise to the child. This
holds good in all the great oral stories. Take as an
example “The Ugly Duckling”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And he flew toward the beautiful swans. As soon as they
saw him they ran to meet him with outstretched wings.</p>

<p>“Kill me,” he said.</p>

<p>But as he bent his head he saw reflected in the water, not
a dark, gray bird ugly to see, but a beautiful swan.</p>

</div>

<p>In Hawthorne’s “Great Stone Face” the climax lies
in the discovery that Ernest is the likeness of the Great
Stone Face, a delightful surprise to the child.</p>

<p>It is the same in “Red Riding Hood,” in “Tarpeia,”
in “Why the Sea Is Salt.” It is the same in Daudet’s
“Last Lesson.” Note the splendid climax of that
masterpiece, the surprise that comes to Franz as he
sits awaiting punishment, when the teacher, in all
kindness, makes this announcement:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My children, this is the last time I shall ever teach you.
The order has come from Berlin that henceforth nothing but
German shall be taught in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine.
This is your last lesson in French.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>With very young children the surprise element should
be simple. Repetition used in a sequence, or jingle,
accomplishes it well, as in the “Fee, fi, faugh, fum”
in “Jack and the Beanstalk,” or “Who’s been sitting
in my chair?” in “The Three Bears,” or “The better
to see you, hear you, eat you” in “Red Riding Hood.”
Each time the child hears the expression his interest is
roused to a higher pitch, and his imagination is fired to
such a point that he expects almost anything to happen.</p>

<p>After the climax is reached, the oral story should
descend rapidly to a close. Many of the best oral
stories end in the climax, and those that do not, add but
a sentence or two or a paragraph at most to round out
to completion. But they do not moralize and point
out a lesson to the child. They leave him to see the
moral for himself, and he sees it more clearly and is
the more deeply impressed by it if he is allowed a few
moments of silence after the completion of the story,
instead of being drawn into conversation concerning
it. Marie Shedlock, the English story-teller who has
done so much to put the narrator’s art upon the plane
where it deserves to be, advocates five minutes of
silence after each story period, and in my own experience
I have found that it is of value to the child.
Conditions under which one works will, of course,
govern this; but above all, do not end a story that
delights a boy or girl and then kill the whole effect by
saying, “Now, Peter, what does that story teach you?”
Give the child credit for being an intelligent human
being, and do not spoil a tale for him by turning it
into a sermon while he is still tingling with the wonder
and joy of it.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_SEVEN">CHAPTER SEVEN<br />
<span class="smcap">Telling the Story</span></h3>

<p>Since story-telling, like music, is an art, it is no
more possible for every mother, teacher, or librarian
to become a Scheherazade than it is possible for
every child who takes music lessons to blossom into a
Mozart or a Mendelssohn. The inspiration, the
creative fire that beguiles the wrath of a sultan or
gives birth to a symphony, emanates from within,
from the fairy germs planted somewhere in the soul
and nurtured into fruition through unceasing effort.
Yet it is possible for every worker with children, provided
he be willing to devote some time and labor to
the study of technique, to learn to tell stories convincingly
and entertainingly, although not with the artistry
of the professional.</p>

<p>First of all, whenever possible, he should choose
stories that appeal to him, those he will enjoy giving
his listeners because they fit his own moods, for he cannot
hope to tell every variety of tale with consummate
excellence any more than an actor can be supreme
in all types of rôles. The genius of Sothern displays
itself to best advantage in the tragedies of Shakespeare,
while that of Henry Miller, Forbes-Robertson, or
David Warfield is suited to dramas of another kind.
Each of these artists tried various rôles until he found
his forte. Then he kept to the field in which he could
excel, concentrating all his effort upon it. So it should
be with the story-teller. He should experiment with
every kind of narrative, then make a specialty of the
one in which he can be at his best, and use it to accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his most far-reaching results. Of course
the mother or teacher cannot confine herself to one
variety of story. Her interests being varied and many,
she cannot hope to reach the height of specialization
attained by the artist who has but one purpose, one
aim, and never swerves from it. She must endeavor
to acquire a fair degree of proficiency in the rendition
of every type of story, that she may not be found wanting
by her youthful auditors; but she should specialize
with the kind of tale that is nearest an expression of
her own moods, because in this way she can obtain
the most gratifying results.</p>

<p>Perhaps she is particularly skilled in presenting
humorous material. Then let her use that ability as
a magnet to draw her hearers to the story period and
to hold them through it to the end. A good plan is
to begin the program with a merry tale to put the
group into a happy, receptive mood, follow it with a
serious one containing the message or information the
children should receive, and then give another humorous
one. The serious narrative may be difficult for her
to handle, and may not be given with the skill and
charm that mark her rendition of another type of
<i>conte</i>, but the children, understanding that one of her
delightful “funny” stories is to follow, will listen
through the less desired number and unconsciously
receive its lesson, because of their eagerness to hear
the succeeding one. Thus, by knowing her field of
excellence and making the most of it, she can carry
children into other fields because of their delight in
meeting her in the one in which she is most at
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>After the story is selected, the atmosphere and
setting should be studied. The teller should have a
clear idea of the topography of the country in which
the events occur, of the customs of the people who
move through it, of their homes, their modes of life,
and their manner of dress, because the more into the
spirit of the tale he can put himself, the more effectively
will he give it. If it be a narrative of Scotland in the
days of Bruce, he should try to hear the bagpipes, see
the lochs and glens of the Highlands, and walk side
by side with the heroes of that time. This means
gleaning many fields for materials and giving something
of an artist’s labor to preparation, in which, of course,
he will be limited by the time at his disposal. But
according to the preparation will be the result, and to
believe previous thought and study unnecessary because
one has natural facility for story-telling is to be
gravely mistaken. Artists of the stage discovered long
ago that no matter how gifted they may be, nothing
can take the place of preparation. Adrienne Lecouvreur
demonstrated the truth of this statement
several centuries ago when she revolutionized acting,
and theatrical folk are still demonstrating it, for in
just this respect lies the difference between the third-
and fourth-rate player and the great dramatic star.
The leading man or woman who is satisfied to learn
lines and do nothing more, does not get beyond stock.
But one ambitious to climb to the top rung of the
histrionic ladder will travel every bypath that may
possibly yield him a fuller and richer comprehension
of the part he has to play. Geraldine Farrar read
everything obtainable about Japan and Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
life before attempting to create the rôle of “Madame
Butterfly,” and Maude Adams spent months studying
the life of the Maid of Orleans, following every step
of her career from the hills of Domrémy to the pyre at
Rouen, before being satisfied to present “Jeanne
d’Arc” at the Harvard Stadium. So it must be with
the story-teller. Only the professional can devote
weeks, or even days, to the preparation of one program,
but every one who attempts to tell stories must know
more than the plot of the tale and must have felt its
events in all their possibilities, if his hearers in their
turn are to feel them.</p>

<p>The amount of preparation necessary varies with
the individual. Those possessing natural facility and
those who heard much story-telling in childhood need
less than those whom Nature has not gifted, or who
were not so fortunate in early environment. But
every one needs some preparation, and there is much
slovenly, valueless story-telling because this fact is
not generally recognized. Many teachers do not
regard story-telling seriously enough, and devote far
less thought to it than to other branches of their
work, because the idea is prevalent that any one can
spin a yarn or two. Consequently they accomplish
little through the medium of the story. But there is
another group of workers who believe that story-telling
means as much today as it meant centuries ago, and
its members are sending children into the libraries. As
nearly as time and the conditions of their work will
permit them, they are following in the footsteps of the
medieval narrator. Like him, they are giving an
artist’s labor to their work because they realize that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
great results come only through great effort. But
the number of these story-tellers, compared with the
workers with children, is very small, and consequently
results are not yet gratifying. They can become
gratifying only when child leaders cease to think that
the story period is the one period of the day for which
no preparation need be made, and realize that every
minute devoted to previous thought and study will
make the language come more spontaneously and
fluently and will bring before the eyes of the listeners
pictures that are clear because they first have been
clear before the eyes of the teller.</p>

<p>Every scene in a story should be visualized until
it is as vivid as a painting on a canvas. It must be
studied and imagined until it shifts smoothly and
rapidly into the succeeding one. Then there will be
no danger of the teller having to pause and think what
comes next, or of having to interpolate something
that should have been introduced at an earlier stage
of the tale. This is not equally easy for every one.
Those who are imaginative by nature will find it no
task, while for others it will be difficult at first. But
no one need be discouraged. Each succeeding attempt
will bring clearer pictures and smoother shifting of
scenes, and gratifying results will follow labor and
perseverance. It is a good plan for the beginner to
jot down in outline form the successive events of the
story and study them until he can carry the sequence
in his mind.</p>

<p>When the pictures are clear and the order of events
is fixed, the story should be practiced. This does not
mean that it should be learned verbatim. Untrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
narrators often make the mistake of memorizing paragraph
by paragraph and sentence by sentence, and
then giving the tale like a recitation, which is not
story-telling at all. Story-telling is a constructive,
creative art, and the tale that grips and convinces and
inspires must be told in a manner that makes it seem
like the teller’s own. Practicing the story means
facing an imaginary audience and describing so vividly
and clearly what is seen that others may see the pictures
that pass before the mind’s eye.</p>

<p>Shall gesture and facial gymnastics be used? This
depends entirely upon the temperament and personality
of the narrator. If it is natural for him to gesticulate
as he speaks, gesture will come spontaneously
and will heighten the effect of the tale. But if movements
of hand and head and body are not spontaneous,
they will mar the rendition and scatter the interest of
the listeners by dividing it between the teller and the
tale. Story-telling then becomes touched with affectation
and loses its artistry. It degrades the story-teller
into a sort of acrobatic performer and makes him a
personage upon whom the attention is centered, which
is not as it should be. He is simply the medium
through which the picture is made clear to the audience.
He is not an actor, and should not occupy the center of
the stage. As Dr. Partridge says: “The story-teller
should pleasingly suggest the mood and scene of the
story, then step into the background, turn down the
lights on the present, and carry his hearers to a distant
region, which he must make, for the time being, more
real than the here and now.” This is why the story-teller
is at his best away from the glare of electricity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
among the shadows of a summer gloaming, or by the
open hearth when the firelight is dim, because then his
hearers do not see him or think of him, but only of the
pictures and scenes painted by his voice and words.</p>

<p>Therefore let the guiding rule of the narrator be,
“I must describe pictures so that others will see them,
and think, not of me, but of the scenes to which I lead
them.” And he must do it in his individual way. If
gesture comes naturally, it belongs in the tale. If it
is studied and artificial, it destroys the effect and value.
Some of the greatest story-tellers of the past used no
gesture, while others used body, head, and hands with
wonderful effect. They were persons of strong individuality
and did things in an individual way. Let
the present-day story-teller profit by their example.</p>

<p>Change of voice in dialogue adds to clearness of
pictures. Nothing is more colorless than a reading
by one whose intonation is not in keeping with the
part he interprets, and the story told in a monotone
is boresome and valueless to the child. He associates
tone and action and wants them to be true to each
other. He is dissatisfied if the old witch speaks like
a loving mother, while the heavy tones of the wicked
giant, the gentle ones of the good fairy, and the mirthful,
rippling notes of the joyous, beautiful maiden
delight him and make him responsive to the tale.
They transform the personages of the story into living,
breathing creatures who walk in his presence and smile
or frown in his face.</p>

<p>Pauses are wonderfully effective in heightening the
interest in a story. Children fairly quiver with expectation
if frequent pauses are used when the moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of suspense grow big. They creep nearer in their
eagerness to hear about what happens next, fearing
that they will miss a bit of the attractive thread. One
small boy, asked why he took such delight in listening
to a certain story-teller, said: “I don’t know if it’s
the way she looks or the way she says it. She’ll be
going along, telling about what happens, and all at
once she’ll say, ‘And then——’ and stop a little bit
until you think all kinds of things are going to happen.”
This feeling is general with children, although they
may not voice it, and behind the naïve words is a
psychological truth. The pause heightens the dramatic
effect and focuses the interest on the coming sentences.</p>

<p>Above all things, there should be no stopping in the
midst of a tale to correct a child. If one shows evidence
of lagging interest, mention his name as if the
story were being told for him. “And, John, when little
Red Riding Hood reached her grandmother’s house
she knocked on the door.” This makes him feel that
although many children are listening to the story, it
is being given solely for his benefit. It touches his
pride and grips his attention long enough to enable
the narrator to muster all his forces and heighten the
interest in the tale so that it will abound in suspense
from that point. If it fails to do that, something is
wrong, either with the selection or the presentation.
Perhaps the pictures are not being made clear because
they were not first clear in the mind of the teller. Perhaps
the story is not an interesting one to that particular
group of children. It is the narrator’s business
to find the reason, just as artists in Europe must learn
what is at fault when their hearers hiss. Audiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
on the Continent are not so polite as those in America,
and there is no mistaking their feeling about a performance.
When sounds of disapproval sweep over the
house, the performer must rise to heights that will
compel admiration or face a ruined career. Likewise,
when a small boy becomes troublesome, the story-teller
should not pause to correct him, but should
make the tale so thrillingly fascinating that the lad
forgets to be naughty. Mothers seldom meet with this
problem, but settlement workers are having to solve it
constantly, and they do it successfully only by knowing
what lies close to the child’s interests and telling stories
that touch those interests.</p>

<p>There are those who denounce story-telling in the
schoolroom because they happen to have known of
poor story-telling and the disorderly conduct that often
ensues when the children’s interest is not held. Not
long ago I came across this statement in the report
of a lecture delivered at a teachers’ institute:</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped that story-telling will soon be
eliminated from the primary grades, and that the
spectacle of a teacher pausing in the midst of a tale
to grasp a child by the arm and exclaim, ‘Here, Johnny,
straighten up and listen,’ will become past history.”</p>

<p>It certainly is to be hoped that such story-telling
will be eliminated, but it is no more fair to condemn
story-telling as an art or to deprecate its value as an
educational or ethical factor because there is poor
story-telling, than it is to decry painting and sculpture
because there are bunglers with brushes and chisels.
The remedy does not lie in abolishing it, but in elevating
the standard of the workers to a higher plane and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in demonstrating that story-telling syncopated by
scoldings and admonitions is not story-telling at all.</p>

<p>When shall we tell stories? Whenever, in the
opinion of the teacher, a story will do more effective
work than something else. Do not depend wholly
on regular periods. These have a place on every school,
library, or settlement program, but the story period
should not be the only time for telling stories, because
often a tale told at the psychological moment will
make a deeper and more lasting impression than those
given during a dozen regular periods. When the
children are tired, tell a story for rest and relaxation.
If there has been a fight or swearing, follow up the
incident as soon as possible with an apt narrative.
It will do more good than moralizing. If the geography
class is struggling over the map of Turkey and
can see nothing but a series of dots and marks on a
piece of paper, put aside the formal recitation for that
day and tell them of the building of the Mosque of
Ahmed the First on the Golden Horn, of the merry
craftsmen who raised the dome of St. Sophia, and
give them some idea of how this glorious waif of the
Orient came to stand on European soil. Make story-telling
fit occasions and conditions instead of trying
to make conditions fit story-telling.</p>

<p>And above all, never moralize! As one authority
says, “It is bad pedagogy and worse art.” Remember
what Dr. van Dyke says: “If a story is worth telling,
moralizing is not necessary.” It is not only unnecessary,
but harmful. The child sees for himself that
virtue is rewarded and evil-doing is punished. He
resents not being given credit for having sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
intelligence to understand it, and a personal application
antagonizes him.</p>

<p>Tell the tale in a direct, unassuming manner—not
as if you are talking down to a group of children, but as
if you are one of the number, talking with them. Boys
and girls dislike the patronizing story-teller as much
as adults dislike the patronizing person, and are quick
to detect affectation and insincerity. They will not
receive the message a posing raconteur has to give,
because his manner of delivering it irritates and estranges
them. The successful story-teller must be
like the poet, a joy bringer, and he can be that only
when his work is marked by sincerity and genuineness
as clear as brook water.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_EIGHT">CHAPTER EIGHT<br />
<span class="smcap">Story-Telling to Lead to an Appreciation of
Literature</span></h3>

<p>One of the specific aims of education is to endow
children with an appreciation of literature, and
to this end much of a teacher’s energy is directed.
From the elementary school through the university
the curriculum includes a course in English, and even
in kindergarten and primary grades a point is made
of introducing children to those authors whose work
is conceded to have a strong appeal for them. The
first, second, or third grade boy is required to read
and memorize selections from Stevenson, Riley, and
Eugene Field; not infrequently he is detained after
school because of failure to have his lesson prepared
at recitation time, and responds to the requirement
in a mood that brings discouragement to his teacher.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are schools in which the
literature or reading hour is a period of joy, where the
learning of songs of the singers of childhood is accomplished
without coercion. These schools are the
ones in which the teachers have learned that the acquisition
of knowledge, to be of real value, must be
attended with enjoyment.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that although the function
of the school is to equip the man, the aim of education
is only to give enjoyment in the future. It is also the
aim of education to give enjoyment now, because in this
way capacity for enjoyment in the future is made
possible. The boy or girl whose early association with
poetry or beautiful prose is attended with displeasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and discomfort is no more likely to be drawn to the
finer types of literature later than the man or woman
is apt to be fond of a person, the first meeting with whom
was a disagreeable experience. If we would have the
man love good literature, we must first lead the child
to love good literature, and we can do this only through
having him enjoy good literature.</p>

<p>Because story-telling brings pleasure to the child,
it is a most effective means of leading him to an appreciation
of literature. Through the medium of the
story we not only can heighten his capacity for enjoyment
and elevate the standard of his taste, but we
can equip him with knowledge he will never acquire
if the literature period is associated with force and
punishment. If a tale brings pleasing pictures before
his eyes and is beautiful in theme and language, he
unconsciously forms a taste for beautiful language,
for he is not only getting the succession of events that
make the plot, but is also absorbing words and expressions.
Certain sentences stick in his memory, and
teachers who have children reproduce stories know that
frequently they use the exact phrases and sentences
that have been used by the teller. They do not remember
these for a day or an hour and then forget
them; they remember them as years go by, and associate
certain words with certain narratives.</p>

<p>William McKinley once said that the mention of
willows by a river made him think of the story of
Moses in the bulrushes, and brought to mind this
sentence: “And she hid the basket among the rushes
in a spot where willows hung over the river.” The
story had been told him in childhood and brought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
enjoyment, and some of the narrator’s expressions left
a lasting imprint on his mind. “I believe that story,
more than anything else,” he once said, “gave me a
fondness for elegant English.”</p>

<p>James A. Garfield voiced almost the same thought,
declaring that his taste for literature was shaped by
stories from great authors told him by his mother
during his early years, and many other men of achievement
have attested to the same truth. They have
proved conclusively out of their own experience that
even with little children it is possible to lay a foundation
upon which a noble and enduring structure can
be built. We can give them an appreciation of stories
and poems that are among the gems of literature.</p>

<p>We can also interest children in the life of an author
so that they will want to know something of his work.
This statement often brings the question, “How,
since little children want stories that are full of action,
and not biographies of men and women they never
have seen?” Is it not true that the childhood of all
great men contained interesting experiences, that if
told as stories will lead little people to want to know
about what these boys and girls did when they grew
up?</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson is a good example. Every
child will listen sympathetically to the tale of the
poor little rich boy who was often so ill that he could
not run and play, but who made the best of things
and amused himself with toys on his bed. He built
cities out of blocks. He watched the lamplighter
go on his evening rounds along the street, and sometimes
in the summer, the dewy, Scotch summer that can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
be pictured so attractively to children, when he went
with his nurse to the country or the shore, he put
leaves and chips in the river and pretended that they
were boats. He dug holes in the sand with his wooden
spade and laughed to see the vagrant waves come up
and fill them. The child who hears about his various
experiences will become intensely interested in little
Robert, and will grow to love “The Land of Counterpane,”
“The River,” “At the Seashore,” and other
selections from <i>A Child’s Garden of Verses</i>. Every
time he reads or hears them he will see a picture of the
wee Scotch lad whose story touched his heart.</p>

<p>This is no untried theory. Through story-telling,
the author of <i>Treasure Island</i> has become a living
personage and <i>A Child’s Garden of Verses</i> a source
of delight in more than one first grade. A teacher
who had charge of forty little Italians devoted fifteen
minutes each morning to stories of writers and their
works, and by the end of the term the children had a
knowledge of Stevenson and Field that amazed the
superintendent. More valuable than the knowledge
acquired was the capacity for real enjoyment of some
of the works of these men, enjoyment so intense that
during the half hour of song and games that was a
feature of every Friday, it was not unusual for a small
Tony or Gulielmo to flutter a brown hand and ask to
be permitted to recite:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Of speckled eggs the birdie sings,</div>
<div class="verse">And nests among the trees.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another teacher was rewarded for her work by
hearing the mother of one of her pupils tell at a parent-teachers’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
meeting of how a certain little lad amused
himself while recuperating from measles by entertaining
the household with songs from Stevenson and
stories about little Robert, who became the big Robert
that wrote the book.</p>

<p>In doing this sort of work, however, it is necessary
to keep in mind the story interests of childhood, to
remember that children are interested in children,
and not begin, “When Robert Louis Stevenson was a
little boy,” but rather, “Once there was a little boy who
lived far away from here, and his name was Robert.”
Let the approach be from the child to the man instead
of from the man to the child. Focus the interest of
children upon one like themselves, then lead in a natural
way to the man and his achievements.</p>

<p>Sometimes children can be interested in a piece of
literature through a story about it or suggested by it,
because often one tale helps to illuminate and clarify
and add interest to another.</p>

<p>Suppose a primary teacher or a mother wishes to
take up Tennyson’s “Sweet and Low,” a piece of
literature that is either a succession of vivid, delightful
pictures or a vague group of words, according to the
manner in which it is presented. Tell of the baby who
lived with the father and mother in a fishing village
on the Isle of Wight. Each day the father had to go
far out to sea in a boat to catch fish to sell for money
with which to buy food for his dear ones, and each
night the baby laughed and crowed when he came home.
Once he stayed later than usual, and baby did not want
to go to bed without seeing him; but the mother sang
a pretty song, saying that father would soon be home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and crooned and rocked her little one until he fell asleep.
It was a pleasant evening, with a big, silver moon,
and a man was out walking—a rich man who lived
in a house on a hill high above the fishers’ huts. As
he went by the cottage where the baby lived, he heard
the mother singing, and the song was so sweet that he
hurried home and wrote what it made him think about.
Then follow with the poem, and the children will receive
it gladly.</p>

<p>This same plan can be used with older children, but
let the material be given in story form instead of as a
series of disconnected incidents.</p>

<p>An excellent method is to give the story of a great
writer’s work. This is effective with children of all
ages, and often leads to the reading of books that otherwise
would never be opened. Sometimes the objection
is made that it is wrong to substitute the story of a
work for the work itself, a statement no thinking person
will gainsay. But this does not mean substitution.
It means whetting the appetite until the child hungers
for the thing you want him to have. Instead of telling
him what he should read, arouse his curiosity to the
point where he wants to read it, and the desired result
will follow. Fifty years ago it was safe to give a boy
or a girl a beautiful piece of literature and tell him he
ought to read it, but it is not safe now, not because
there is anything wrong with the children of our time,
but because conditions are different. Books were rare
and costly then, and young people read whatever
came to hand. Today books are cheap and plentiful,
and present-day literature plunges directly into the
complications of the story. People are in a hurry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
know what it is all about, because of the spirit of the
age. There is less leisure now than there was half
a century ago, as there is more competition, and results
must be realized more rapidly than our forefathers
realized them. Consequently we travel faster,
get rich faster, and move more speedily in every way.
Present-day literature reflects present-day spirit, and
the story must begin with the opening sentence. Boys
and girls simply will not go through pages of introductions
and descriptions before striking the plot of
the tale, no matter how beautiful those introductions
and descriptions may be. They want books that
get somewhere from the beginning. So the problem
confronts all who are interested in the education of
children: “How can we make them as eager to read
Dickens, Scott, and Thackeray as they are to read
Jack London and Phillips Oppenheim? How can they
be made to go as gladly to Bulwer Lytton as they go to
the Henty books?” By means of story-telling. Give
them an idea of the plots of the masters of literature,
enough to whet the desire to know more about them.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient just to tell the story, because it
was not the plots of these writers that made them great
artists. It was their manner of handling their plots,
their delineation of character, the philosophy and
human wisdom they put into the mouths of their heroes,
and the boy or girl who does not become acquainted
with these great creators during school days is likely
never to know them, because he forms a taste for reading
of a more ephemeral nature, and he may go through
life a devourer of books, yet be only half educated.</p>

<p>Why is it that so many young people never look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the English classics after they leave high school, and
would rather spend a morning at hard labor than in
reading <i>As You Like It</i> or <i>A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</i>? Because too much attention was given to
the dissecting process when they studied these plays.
Instead of being taught to see the beautiful and finished
creation of some master, they were made to see the
skeleton and to pull it to pieces. Some teachers assign
a certain number of pages or paragraphs or stanzas
for a lesson, and the pupils look up the words in the
dictionary, point out the figures of speech, and scan
the lines. Sometimes the teacher reads the assignment
when it is made. Sometimes children dramatize
it after they have torn it into shreds, or write a paraphrase.
But the heart and soul of the masterpiece,
the sheer beauty of it, are considered least of all, and
students end by heartily hating something that they
might have enjoyed and loved. Yet people wonder
why the average American has so little appreciation
of good literature, and think something is wrong with
young folk who, after a high-school course in English,
will read nothing but popular novels. There is nothing
whatsoever the matter with the boys and girls.
They simply follow the bent of all human beings and
steer from the unpleasant toward the pleasant. They
go to the books of the day that they can understand,
because much of our great literature, presented as it
is, means nothing to them. Less fortunate than
youths of fifty years ago, they are not forced to read
good books if they read at all. There are verdant,
if less beautiful, meadows on every side where they
may browse, and into them they go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>It is infinitely better that a child’s school life provide
him with a capacity for the enjoyment of literature
than that he have a technical knowledge of a few
pieces of literature, because the latter endows him with
a narrow, academic viewpoint, while the former makes
possible a future growth, without a capacity for which
life must be narrow and one-sided. A boy or girl
may know that Shakespeare wrote <i>Twelfth Night</i> or
<i>Macbeth</i>, that Milton created “The Hymn to the
Nativity” or Shelley “The Skylark,” be able to paraphrase
each and analyze the sentences that comprise
them, and not be a bit better fitted for life than he would
be without that knowledge. But he is better equipped
for life if he has acquired a capacity for the enjoyment
of literature, so that to read a great book gives him
pleasure or causes him to respond with sympathy, and
the English teacher who does not develop this capacity
in children has failed in his function.</p>

<p>The approach to the great field of literature must be
through specific examples, just as the approach to an
understanding of art or architecture must be through
the canvases of Raphael, Cimabue, or Giotto, or the
temples that were the triumphs of Egyptian, Babylonian,
or Hellenic builders. But if they are to be enjoyed,
acquaintance with these specific examples must
be made in a pleasurable manner. They first must be
beheld in a perspective that gives glimpses of them as
complete and beautiful wholes, and not through the detailed
workmanship of architrave or abacus or by focusing
the attention on the massing of figures according to
square or triangular outline. And just as the understanding
and enjoyment of one great structure or painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
give added interest to every other one, so, in the
realm of literature, each masterpiece enjoyed gives
capacity for the enjoyment of every other masterpiece
met with in the future. Therefore the story, because
it is a means of flashing the entire structure on the screen
and making it possible for children to see the completed
whole in all its beauty, is the English teacher’s most
valuable tool.</p>

<p>Take <i>Evangeline</i> as an example. Most children leave
school knowing that Longfellow wrote that poem, and
that Evangeline lost her lover on the wedding day and
spent the remainder of her life seeking him. But
you cannot coax them to read the poem again because
of the memory of the time when they studied it. And
the pity of it is that there is no work of American
literature so appealing to boys and girls in the adolescent
period as <i>Evangeline</i>, if it is presented wisely.</p>

<p>Before they are asked to study it, if the story of the
Acadian girl is told sympathetically and feelingly they
are touched by its pathos and fired by the idealism of
its characters, and they feel the charm of life in the
quaint old village of Grand Pré. If, before they are
told to read it, they have gone with the heroine through
the magic of the narrator’s picturing, in her wanderings
over mountain and lowland, into Indian camp and
sequestered mission, living among strange peoples and
sleeping by strange fires, they will read it with enthusiasm.
It will become a joy instead of a burden, because
they will have felt something of what was in the
heart of the poet who wrote it, and not merely what
appeared on the printed page.</p>

<p>Besides the main thread of the story, there are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sub-stories that, if told in connection with the poem,
will add to the child’s enjoyment and understanding
of it. Sometimes a name is rich in story material, yet
often it is passed over with nothing more than a definition
found in the pronouncing gazetteer, and a
golden opportunity is lost.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the line, “Now in the Tents of
Grace of the gentle Moravian missions.” There is a
footnote in most editions stating, “This refers to the
Moravian mission of Gnädenhütten.” But what does
that signify to children, since there were many missions
in those early days? But if they are told of how the
Moravians came from the distant German mountains
to plant the tree of their faith in the Western wilds,
they grow interested. They are fascinated as the tale
goes on, picturing how these simple folk founded a
mission in the woods of Ohio, which they named
“Gnädenhütten” or “Tents of Grace,” and telling how
a massacre occurred there in 1790, not savages killing
off whites, but a band of marauding British troops
slaughtering Christianized Indians as they toiled peacefully
in their cornfields. Then, as Evangeline roams
over the Southwest, into the bayou country of Louisiana,
if pictures of the early life there are painted
vividly by the story-teller, if she gives some of the
events of old Creole days, the children will look forward
to the <i>Evangeline</i> period.</p>

<p>This same method will add enjoyment to the study
of other pieces of literature. <i>The Courtship of Miles
Standish</i>, aside from the main plot, is rich in stories
from the Bible. The children should look up these
allusions, but the teacher should put life into them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by giving the story. In fact, there is no piece of literature
studied below the high school, or even during
the early part of the high-school course, that cannot
be presented with splendid results through the story-telling
method. The concrete precedes the abstract
in the order in which selections are considered, those
through which a story thread runs being given in advance
of the essay or treatise. By making the most of
this story thread, literature study will become pleasurable
and bring splendid response from the children. It
requires effort and preparation, but it pays. It is
worth much to the teacher who loves good literature,
to look back over the years and think of the children
she has led to appreciate and enjoy it. It is a tremendous
satisfaction to have boys come back long
after leaving her schoolroom and seek her out, because
through her they learned to know something of the
comfort that is to be found in good old books. One
teacher, speaking of her experience, said: “It made all
the effort seem richly worth while, when a broad-shouldered,
sun-burned man went three hundred miles
out of his way to see me on a home visit to America,
and thank me for having led him to enjoy poetry.”
As a boy he became intensely interested in <i>The Lady
of the Lake</i> because his teacher gave the stories of Fitz-James
and Roderick Dhu and of the clan life of the
Highlands, and a pocket edition of Scott was a source
of comfort to him during a surveying expedition in the
wilds of West Australia, and took away the loneliness of
nights spent by a camp fire with no companions save the
native woodmen. He had learned to know Scott during
his boyhood, and the capacity for enjoyment acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
through that association was a priceless possession to
the man. If more teachers realized that story-telling
is a direct road to the understanding of literature, and
that it has its place in grammar and high-school grades
as much as in the kindergarten, there would be less
drudgery for them and more satisfying results.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_NINE">CHAPTER NINE<br />
<span class="smcap">Story-Telling to Awaken an Appreciation of
Music</span></h3>

<p>The public school aims not only to give boys and
girls a training that shall equip them with
ability to gain a livelihood and provide for their material
wants, but to give them resources within themselves
from which to draw pleasure, broaden and
deepen the emotional powers, enrich the soul by endowing
it with capacity to respond to the beautiful and
fine, and make them more sympathetic toward the joys
and sorrows of their fellows. That is why the curriculum
includes a course in music, drawing, and subjects
that are branches of a great art. We do not expect
to make professional musicians or painters of all the
children who receive instruction, but aim to give the
average child, the one who will grow to be an average,
ordinary man, an appreciation of the things that give
color and beauty to life and make him richer in mind
and happier.</p>

<p>Taste is formed by what is heard in youth, and the
child whose early years are associated with ragtime
grows to be a devotee of ragtime, while he who hears
the music of the masters becomes a man who loves
great music. This is why the average European has
a knowledge and love of melody that amazes Americans.
He has heard good music from infancy. It is
sung in the public meeting places of his town and
whistled in the streets. The gamin of Naples, Rome,
and Venice knows the arias from the operas as well as
American children know their national anthem, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Verdi, Donizetti, and Rossini are more than names
to him. He has heard their melodies from infancy,
and his father or uncle or some street story-teller has
familiarized him with the plots of their librettos. He
knows something of the artists who sing the rôles,
also, because the tailor and the barber and the baker
not infrequently go to hear them, and they are a topic
of conversation in the home. Here in America we
have not had such opportunities. With us the opera
and the symphony orchestra are exotics which only a
minority has been trained to enjoy, and consequently
we cannot be regarded as a musical people.</p>

<p>It is natural that this should be so, because, as compared
with Continental lands, we are very young, and
youth cannot hope to compete with maturity. But
artistic standards in the United States are being raised
steadily. Most of our great cities now have symphony
orchestras and a season of opera, while the municipal
band concert is part of the life of comparatively small
towns, and the programs are of a higher order than
formerly. We are on the upward move, and meanwhile
every leader of children should do his part in the great
work of helping to elevate the national musical
standard.</p>

<p>The schools are doing something, but not enough,
because much of the instruction they give is of a technical
nature, and although pupils can read in several
keys and beat time correctly, it does not follow that
they are acquiring a capacity for the enjoyment of
good music. Until one has sufficient mental development
to understand something of the price that must
be paid for artistic success, much attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
technical vitiates interest in music, just as the dissecting
method of study kills interest in literature. Many
teachers make more of an effort to have children learn
to read music than they do to have them enjoy it, and
this close attention to the mechanics of the art makes
the music period burdensome instead of enjoyable.
Before the child can see any incentive in learning do—re—mi,
he must hear and enjoy music and must understand
that do—re—mi is a key that will unlock gates
into larger fields of enjoyment. Because the hour is
replete with drudgery rather than joy, the discipline
of the music class is often a good deal of a problem,
and although it is not an ideal condition, it exists more
frequently than most people realize. A teacher whose
class distinguished itself in sight singing at an institute,
was asked how she made its members so proficient.</p>

<p>“Simply by keeping a strap on my desk and using
it about every seven minutes,” she replied; “and those
who did not have actual contact with it kept straight
because they knew it was there.”</p>

<p>This is perhaps an extreme case, but the school-rooms
in which the music lesson is a period of nervous
strain for both teacher and pupils are numerous, and
it is not strange that sometimes trustees question
whether it might not be well to eliminate music from
the list of public-school subjects.</p>

<p>An adage of the old Italian school of vocalists,
whose methods have given so many glorious songsters
to the world, was, “To sing, you must be happy,”
and one of the most celebrated prima donnas of today
attributes a large measure of her success to the fact
that during childhood her mother had the wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
never to make music burdensome by forcing her to it,
but played for her and sang to her without stint, giving
her countless opportunities of hearing music and
leading her to love it. Then when she began formal
study at twelve, her teacher did not harass her with
exercises, but gave simple songs that she liked to sing,
songs chosen to give her voice the exercise it needed
and to appeal to the natural love of melody.</p>

<p>We might well apply this plan to our public-school
music, and arrange courses so that children will hear
much good music, even if the amount of technical
work has to be greatly lessened. It is here that the
story may do its far-reaching work in helping to make
the music period pleasurable to the children and causing
them to respond with keener pleasure to a higher
standard of music.</p>

<p>Many narrators exclaim, “It is not possible for me
to lead children to appreciate the great music when
I do not know the great music myself.”</p>

<p>But it is possible. Of course it is easier for one who
is familiar with the masterpieces of melody to lead
children to them than for one who is not; but even
though the mother or teacher was not in her own
childhood familiar with Mozart or Mendelssohn, she
can bring children to appreciate these artists because
the talking machine has made it possible. She need
not try to acquaint them with the technical terms, and
mechanics of music, but she can arouse an interest
that is the twin sister of inspiration, and she can do
it in such a way that every minute devoted to the
work is filled with delight. She can tell the life story
of some great composer and familiarize the child with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
selections from his work that will guide him away from
the cheap and tawdry. She can give him incidents
connected with the composition of musical gems, and
a glimpse into the great treasure house of musical
literature that will cause him to want to know more of
the achievements of the immortal melody makers. It
is not necessary that one be a musician in order to
do this. Most schools and many homes are now
supplied with talking machines, and the records manufactured
by the different companies bring masterpieces
within the reach of all. Even the catalogs are rich in
suggestion, and following the cues supplied by them,
a little thought and labor will bring most gratifying
results. Almost all the great composers had eventful
childhoods, and the early days of Mendelssohn,
Mozart, Bach, Haydn, Handel, Beethoven, Chopin,
Verdi, Wagner, and many others are rich in incidents
that children enjoy hearing. These biographies, sources
for which are listed in the appended bibliography
(<a href="#Page_94">page 94</a>), if told in story form and followed by selections
from the artist’s works, will make an impression
and arouse an interest as nothing else can do. Do not,
however, make the mistake of beginning with the man
and leading down to his childhood. Begin with his
early years and lead up to his achievements. The
child will become interested in the man only through
his childhood, because children are near his own interests,
while adults are not. Many inexperienced
story-tellers do not understand this, and are disappointed
in their failure to hold their little hearers.
This was demonstrated not long ago in a university
course in story-telling. An incident in the childhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of Mozart was to be given in story form to introduce
some of that composer’s works to a group of children.
Eighty per cent of the five hundred preparing the
paper began thus: “When the great Mozart was a
little boy.” That introduction meant nothing to the
children, because they did not know “the great Mozart,”
and were not interested in strange men. But
they were intensely interested in hearing about a child
who long, long ago was sailing down the Danube with
his father and sister Marianne and was very much
distressed because the father would have to pay duty
on the harp they carried and therefore, when they
reached Vienna, Marianne could not have a new dress
that she sadly needed. Little eyes sparkled and little
hands clapped when the children heard how, as they
reached the customhouse of the Austrian capital, young
Wolfgang asked his father if he might play something
on the harp, and his rendition so delighted and amazed
the officials that the duty was waived and Marianne
was shabbily clad no longer.</p>

<p>There are many musical stories besides those of lives
of the composers that should be given to children:
tales of the violin makers of Cremona, the minnesingers,
the troubadours, the meistersingers, Pan and his
pipes, Apollo and the lyre, David and the harp, King
Alfred and the harp, the harp at Tara, the Crusaders
bringing some stringed instruments into Europe, the
development of the orchestra, the evolution of the harp
from the bended bow of the early tribesmen, and the
making of the piano. Stories of some of the operas,
especially those based on the legends of the Grail and
the Rhinegold, are delightful tales to give to children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>A good way to introduce children to a composer is
by combining the story of his life with selections from
his work, as in the following story about Schubert.
This method may be applied to the study of any composer.
Libraries are rich in materials, and the talking-machine
companies bring the music within the reach
of all; so there is no reason why the story-teller should
not do his part in making our nation a music-loving
land, as well as give pleasure to the children under his
guidance.</p>

<p>“Whoever puts a beautiful thought or melody into
the world,” writes an Indian poet, “gives more than
a diamond of Golconda.” Whoever helps a child to
understand and enjoy beautiful thoughts and melodies,
gives in almost as great a measure as their creator.
He too is a builder, leaving behind him something fit
to stand, and labor of that kind does not go unrequited.</p>

<h4>A BOY OF OLD VIENNA</h4>

<p>Little Franz could hardly wait for the sun to rise. He had
lain awake all night thinking of what morning would bring,
and it seemed as if the long, dark hours would never end.
But now it was dawn, and he knew that very soon the sun
would gild the hilltops, and then the thing of which he had
dreamed for days would come to pass.</p>

<p>“Are you up, Franz?” his mother called from below.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered cheerily, “up and dressing.”</p>

<p>The mother smiled at him as he ran down into the kitchen,
for she knew how eagerly he had looked forward to this day.
Josef, the kindly neighbor, had promised to take him that
very morning to a warehouse where many fine pianos were
kept, and he would spend hours among the beautiful instruments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
there. No wonder he was glad! The one his father
provided for him was cheap and harsh, for Herr Schubert
was just a poor schoolmaster and had few coins to spend
for anything besides food and clothing. But that did not
keep Franz from doing wonders with his music. He learned
all he could from his brothers, and worked away at the poor
piano because he could not help it. Now that he was soon
to touch the keyboard of a really splendid instrument, he
felt like a prince in a fairy tale.</p>

<p>They went out of the house and along the dingy street in
which the Schuberts lived. Across the Danube they passed
by the old stone bridge that led to the Ringstrasse, then northward
into that part of the city where the warehouses stood.
Groups of citizens in holiday attire hurried by, and now and
then some great lord or lady in a fine carriage passed them
on the way to worship at St. Stephen’s. But Franz thought
only of reaching the warehouse, and he walked so fast that
Josef, who was short and fat, began to grow red in the face and
pant, and he was quite as glad as the boy when they reached
the building.</p>

<p>Franz lost no time in getting to a piano. Sunday comes
just once a week, and another would not come for seven long
days. He sat down at one of the lovely instruments, playing
and singing as if nothing in the world mattered so much as
music. He was only eleven years old, and boys of that age
usually want to be out with others, engaged in the sports
and games boys love. But not so with Franz Schubert. He
was happiest at his music. He played and played and was
so busy that he did not see a stranger come into the warehouse
or hear his voice in earnest conversation with Josef.</p>

<p>“You say he has had no music masters?” the man asked
wonderingly.</p>

<p>Josef shook his head. “None but his brothers, Ignace
and Ferdinand, and once, for a very short time, his father
sent him to a singing tutor. But he said he could teach him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
nothing, for when he thought to give him something new he
found he had learned it already.”</p>

<p>“Surely he is a wonder child,” the stranger remarked.
“Be sure to tell his father to bring him tomorrow and we will
try him.”</p>

<p>Then he passed out, but Franz did not see him. Nor did
he know a word that had been spoken until on the way home,
when Josef told him that the emperor’s choirmaster had
passed by and was so pleased with his singing and playing
that he wanted him in the royal choir.</p>

<p>So little Franz Schubert became a choir boy, and the
master wondered more and more that one so young could
know so much of music.</p>

<p>Then he went to a boys’ school. His clothes were not very
fine, for he was poor. But he wore the best he had, a light
gray suit that was far from handsome. Some of the richer
boys thought it funny and nicknamed him “the miller.”
But when Franz passed the severe singing examination so
well that he was given one of the gold-braided honor uniforms,
they did not tease him again. No one else did as well
in the orchestra as the little Schubert lad. No one else sang
as understandingly as he, and his master and fellow students,
like the royal choirmaster, called him a wonder child. Every
boy in the school liked him, and Franz liked them all too,
but especially a young man named Spaun. And Spaun’s
name is remembered to this day just because once upon a
time he was kind to little Franz Schubert. He was almost
twenty when Franz was but eleven, but they were jolly companions
and the best of friends.</p>

<p>One day Franz said, “If I had some paper I know I could
write a song.”</p>

<p>But paper he had not, because his father could not afford
to buy it. Spaun always had a little money to spend, however,
so Franz got the paper and wrote the song, and after
that his friend supplied him with writing material. He enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
doing it because he liked the lad, but he did not realize
that it would mean much to the world. It did mean a great
deal, however, for some of the songs Franz wrote during his
school days are still sung as among the sweetest in the world,
and perhaps but for Spaun’s paper they might not have
been written.</p>

<p>Well, Franz grew up just as other boys grow, and still
he went on loving music and working at it, playing and writing
songs. Almost everything he read or saw made him think
of a melody, and every melody that formed in his brain was
beautiful.</p>

<p>One evening he went into a restaurant in Vienna for his
dinner. He had a small copy of Shakespeare in his pocket,
and as he waited to be served he took it out and read. His
eye fell upon the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Hark, hark! the lark at heaven’s gate sings,</div>
<div class="verse">And Phœbus ’gins arise,</div>
<div class="verse">His steeds to water at those springs</div>
<div class="verse">On chaliced flowers that lies.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They made him think of a song, and he looked about for
paper upon which to write it. He asked the waiter to get him
a piece, but the waiter could find nothing but a bill of fare.
Schubert took that and wrote his melody, and when Shakespeare’s
words were sung to it, the song sounded like this:</p>

<p>[At this point in the story run a record of “Hark, hark the
lark.”]</p>

<p>Another time he was passing through a poor quarter of
Vienna and heard a peasant serenading a girl. Schubert did
not think the song a very pretty one, and he went home and
wrote one that he liked better. This is how it sounds:</p>

<p>[Record of “The Serenade.”]</p>

<p>When Franz Schubert was a little child, he heard his father
tell an old German story. It was called “The Erl King” and
was about a witchlike creature who was supposed to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
children from their parents. Franz always remembered it,
and after he grew to manhood and read Goethe’s poem,
“The Erl King,” a friend told him how the master came to
write it. One wild winter night the poet was visiting in the
home of a physician and a man came riding through the
storm, seeking help for the child he had with him. The little
fellow was delirious with fever and kept clinging to his father,
crying and begging him not to let the Erl King take him away.
The incident affected Goethe so deeply that he wrote the
poem, and Schubert, hearing the story, was so touched by it
that he composed wonderful music to go with the master’s
words.</p>

<p>[Record of “The Erl King.”]</p>

<p>Another poem of Goethe’s that he read told of a wild rose
growing on a heath. A boy saw the rose and said, “I will
pluck you.” The rose said, “No, no. If you do I will prick
you.” The foolish boy laughed and picked the rose, and it
kept its word. This is the song Schubert made of the poem:</p>

<p>[Record of “Hedge Roses.”]</p>

<p>So you see that almost everything made Franz Schubert
think of music. He wrote many, many songs and much
other music, and although it is almost a hundred years since
he died, his name and his works will live as long as men love
melody. The greatest singers in the world use his songs over
and over because rich and poor alike love them, and whenever
singers want to be very sure of pleasing they sing some
of the songs of him who was once a boy in old Vienna, Franz
Schubert.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_TEN">CHAPTER TEN<br />
<span class="smcap">Story-Telling to Awaken an Appreciation of
Art</span></h3>

<p>The child who is surrounded by good pictures
from his earliest years grows to love good
pictures, and gaudily colored, cheap ones have no
charm for him. His taste has been formed for the
fine and true, and nothing else will satisfy him. To
behold a beautiful painting gives him pleasure, while
to see a glaring chromo produces an unpleasant sensation.
This is not because he is different by nature
from one to whom masterpieces have no meaning,
but because he has learned to know them.</p>

<p>Here again we have one of the striking differences
between the average American and the average European.
The Italian, French, Austrian, or German
laborer sees masterpieces from infancy. His earliest
recollection of religious worship is associated with
them. Every continental town has its art gallery or
picture exhibit, and on certain days there is no admission
fee. The laborer avails himself of this opportunity.
On Sunday, when he is free from toil, he
makes a festival of the occasion and takes his family
to some park or place of amusement, and very frequently
the jaunt includes a trip to the picture gallery.
Consequently, even the children of those lands have a
knowledge of the masterpieces of art far surpassing
that of the average adult American.</p>

<p>In most respects the Italian street gamin does not
differ from the guttersnipe of our own land, but in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
he is vastly his superior. He knows the free days at
the galleries as well as he knows the alleys of his native
town, and is a liberal patron of such places on those
occasions. I once made the acquaintance of a little
chap in Rome who was an excellent guide. He piloted
me among the treasures of the Vatican with the ease
and security that bespeaks thorough knowledge, for
he had been there so often that he knew in just which
rooms or alcoves to find his favorites. He knew
much of the artists, too, of their lives and times, their
discouragements and successes. Yet this Roman street
boy was no exception to his class. Along the Piazza
di Spagna, in fact, on any of the highways, are dozens
like him, rich in knowledge of the statues and fountains
that glorify the streets and parks of the Holy City.
The names of Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Fra Angelico,
Giotto, and those other men who built or carved or
painted with marvelous power, are fraught with meaning
to them, and it is not strange that it should be
so. Children in Italy have grown up among beautiful
things. For centuries beauty has been almost a religion
to this joy-loving, sun-loving race, and the country
of the Apennines, as Francis Hopkinson Smith says, is
the one place in the world where a song or a sunset is
worth more than a soldo. Consequently, the Italians
are a nation of art lovers. Each individual regards the
masterpieces as his property, and the reason the
Italian people hate the memory of Napoleon is not
only that he conquered parts of their land, but that
he robbed Italy of some of her art treasures. These
were things they and their fathers had seen and loved,
and they could not forgive the vandal who carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
them away, even after the wound left by the victor
had ceased to rankle.</p>

<p>Here in America we have not had the opportunity
of the average European, but already we have made
a beginning, and we now possess a number of art
galleries that deserve the name. At the present
time these are found only in the large cities, but they
are helping to form national standards. Meanwhile
every worker with children ought to try to lead those
intrusted to his care to a knowledge and appreciation
of great pictures.</p>

<p>It is not enough to place reproductions of masterpieces
in schools and homes and say nothing about
them. If children are to have an appreciation of
them, they must be led to see their beauty, to understand
what they mean, to have some idea of the infinite
patience and labor that made their creation
possible. The child of an artistic bent will observe
and study them without aid or guidance and unconsciously
grow into loving them, because beauty in any
form attracts him as a magnet draws a bar of steel.
But teachers and parents do not work solely with budding
genius, and in the great scheme of human advancement
it may mean as much for many <i>average</i>
children to appreciate and love art, as for one who is
gifted to reach immortal heights of achievement. The
average child must be led and directed. His interest
must be aroused before we can hope to mold his taste
as we would have it molded. He must be taught to
see that a Gainsborough is more beautiful than an
advertising chromo, that a face by Raphael is the
expression of an inspiration that is almost divine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Only through an association that gives pleasure will
he come to see and appreciate, and here again story-telling
can work wonders, because through it we can
intensify a child’s delight in a picture.</p>

<p>In the field of art the biographical tale is of immeasurable
value, for the story of an artist’s life,
illustrated by reproductions of his works, can be made
the pathway to appreciation.</p>

<p>In establishing standards of art appreciation, as
well as those of music, we must not lose sight of the
story interests of childhood, because many a picture
that is a great artistic achievement is not suitable
to present to little children. The “Venus and Cupid”
of Velasquez is a glorious masterpiece, but we cannot
expect little folk to admire it any more than we can
expect those in the rhythmic period to listen to a King
Arthur story and ask to hear it again. As the little
child does not know Venus and Cupid, a portrayal
of them means nothing to him. But he does know
horses and dogs and cats. He knows other children
and babies and mothers, and therefore he enjoys
pictures of animal and child life and will be interested
in hearing about their portrayers.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds is an excellent artist to begin
with, because his best work is built around themes
dear to the heart of childhood. His “Age of
Innocence,” “Infant Samuel,” “Robinetta,” “Heads
of Angels,” “Simplicity,” and “The Strawberry Girl”
are ideal works to present to the small child, and this
painter’s early years make a charming story.</p>

<p>Sir Edwin Landseer is another artist with whom we
can acquaint little children, through the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
works: “Uncle Tom and His Wife for Sale,” “Low
Life and High Life,” “Dignity and Impudence,” “A
Distinguished Member of the Humane Society,” “The
Sick Monkey,” “King Charles Spaniels,” and many
other paintings, all of which will be loved by children
because they love the subjects.</p>

<p>Rosa Bonheur and her paintings should be used in
this period. Children are especially fond of “The
Horse Fair,” “Coming from the Fair,” “Brittany
Sheep,” “Highland Cattle,” and “A Norman Sire.”
In fact, everything this painter created, like all the
work of Landseer, is fraught with interest to the
child, because she was solely a portrayer of animal
life.</p>

<p>An artist of whom little folk have been taught almost
nothing is Gainsborough. Usually we think of him
only as a portrait painter, because in America his
likenesses of women are better known than his other
pictures. But it is a mistake to associate him only
with “the dashing, smashing hats worn by the Duchess
of Devonshire.” Until recently only Americans who
had traveled in England had an opportunity of seeing
or knowing the greater part of this artist’s other work,
because the British copyright law protected much of
it in such a way that cheap prints could not be made.
Now, however, it is possible to get good reproductions
of these long-protected Gainsboroughs at a very
reasonable price. Most valuable of the works of this
artist to use with little children are the following:
“The Market Cart,” “The Watering Place,” “Two
Dogs,” “Rustic Children,” and “Study of an Old
Horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Murillo is an ideal painter to introduce to the little
child, because his childhood story is as fascinating
as his creations are glorious. Children never tire of
hearing about this joyous little Spanish boy, and of
the time when he transformed the family picture,
turning the halo of the Christ-child into a gorgeous
sombrero, and making a dog of the sheep. As they
laugh or sympathize with the wonder child of Seville
and feel something of the charm of life in that old city,
its street children, immortalized on canvas by its most
illustrious son, become comrades because little Bartolome
sometimes played with them and big Bartolome
painted them. There is a long list of this master’s works
from which to choose, but the following are particularly
enjoyed: “Mother and Child,” “The Adoration of
the Shepherds,” “St. John and the Lamb,” “The
Melon Eaters,” “The Dice Players,” “Beggar Boys,”
“The Good Shepherd,” “The Marriage of St. Catherine,”
and “The Immaculate Conception.” No attempt
should be made to interpret the two last-named
pictures. Familiarize little people with them and
lead them to see their beauty, but waive all idea of
religious symbolism until years bring maturity of
thought and the child makes his own interpretation.</p>

<p>All Madonna pictures are interesting to little children,
so by all means acquaint them with Raphael,
the king. Let them drink in the beauty of “The
Sistine Madonna,” “The Madonna of the Chair,”
“The Madonna of the Goldfinch,” and as many others
as can be obtained. The story of Raphael belongs
more properly in the intermediate period than in the
very early one, because so little is known of this painter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
life before he began his career. Just tell the children
of the little boy who lived in far-away Urbino
long, long ago. His mother died when he was a wee
little fellow, and he lived alone with his father, who
was very kind to him. Instead of playing much,
as the other children did, he loved to sit and listen
to stories about saints and good people who lived
before his time. He loved to draw pictures, too,
and when he grew to be a man he became a wonderful
painter.</p>

<p>Closely following Raphael may come Correggio,
through his “Holy Night,” “Repose in Egypt,” and
“Cherubs.”</p>

<p>Van Dyck, too, may be made familiar to little
children. From his works choose “Children of Charles
I” and several details from this picture—“Baby
Stuart,” “Charles II,” and “Henrietta.” But present
first the complete picture, so that when “Baby
Stuart” is seen the children will know that it is only
part of a painting. Many a grown person does not
realize that it is a detail from another work, and this
fact should be understood by every child who sees the
royal baby. Other works by this artist suitable to
introduce to tiny people are “The Repose in Egypt,”
“Madonna and Child,” and “The Donators.”</p>

<p>There are many painters whose pictures will be enjoyed
by children of from five to eight, and the teacher
or parent who knows art and art literature can choose
for himself, keeping always in mind the story interests.
To those who have little or no knowledge of art, yet
who want to lead children along this path, the following
list will be helpful:</p>

<p>Children of the intermediate period enjoy the works
of the great landscape painters, Claude Lorrain,
Corot, Breton, and others who portrayed the woods
and fields, especially when they know something of
the childhood of these men. In this period, too, they
should become better acquainted with some of the
artists they have already met. Add to the interest
previously created in Raphael by taking up such works
as “Madonna of the Fish,” “Madonna of the Well,”
and “Madonna of the Diadem.” In telling the story
of his life use Ouida’s beautiful tale, “The Child of
Urbino,” which is so exquisitely told that there is
nothing lovelier in literature. Show the children his
portrait of himself, his “St. Catherine,” “St. Cecilia,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
“St. John in the Desert,” “Peter and John at the
Beautiful Gate,” and “The Miraculous Draught of
Fishes.”</p>

<p>Add to the interest already created in Rubens by
taking up his “Portrait of Himself,” “The Flight of
Lot,” and the paintings illustrating the life of Maria
de’ Medici.</p>

<p>Pictures representing the Crucifixion, the Descent
from the Cross, and the Entombment, no matter how
glorious they may be as works of art, should not be
presented to children. They are too highly religious
for children’s understanding, and the tragedy portrayed
in them should not enter into childhood. The
Madonnas and Holy Families may be used freely,
because they portray dear and familiar characters
and are saturated with an atmosphere of happiness
that gladdens the child.</p>

<p>The following list will aid those who are not connoisseurs:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Artists and Paintings for Children of the
Intermediate Period</span></h4>

Sheep Shearing; Potato Planting; Bundling Wheat; Returning

</div>

<p>There is a twofold reason for introducing children
to such painters as Millet, Breton, and Jacques.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Besides giving them a knowledge of the works of the
artists in question and adding to their appreciation
of the beautiful, it will dignify labor in their eyes to
learn that it inspired these great creators. If leaders
of the “back to the land” movement would make
free use of the art of the world among children, if
during the years when impressions made are deep and
lasting they would tell stories and show pictures that
have been inspired by toilers in the fields, a sentiment
would be created that would tell in results, because
of boys and girls having learned to respect those who
till the soil and work with their hands.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_ELEVEN">CHAPTER ELEVEN<br />
<span class="smcap">Dramatization</span></h3>

<p>Contemporaneous with what may be termed
a renaissance in story-telling is a strong sentiment
in favor of dramatization. Child leaders have
observed that children dramatize spontaneously, and
that after they have heard a tale they often play it
without suggestion from an older person. They impersonate
the characters, crudely perhaps, but they
represent the action and portray the story as they
understand it.</p>

<p>This they do because the dramatic instinct is a universal
instinct. We are all born imitators, and we like
to experience the feelings and experiences of others.
That is why the little girl impersonates her mother
and takes delight in dressing in grown-up attire and
playing lady. It is what actuates the boy to play
Indian or soldier or fireman. He wants to live through
the experiences of Indians and soldiers and firemen; so
he goes into the world of make-believe and acts the
part. During that time he is a larger and a different
personality. He is not a little boy who must go to
bed before he wants to, and must stay inside the yard
when he longs to be out on the highway; he is a grown
man in a uniform dashing along on an engine; he is
a mighty chief in feathers and war paint, leading his
tribe against the enemy or speaking words of wisdom
around the council fire.</p>

<p>There was a time when this sort of play was believed
to be of no value beyond that of a romp that helped
to stretch the muscles, but today there is a very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
attitude toward it. Close observation of children
and a more general knowledge of psychology have
brought educators to realize that imitative play is a big
factor in mental development. As the boy impersonates
a fireman or Indian he must choose movements
in keeping with the part and reject those not in
keeping with it. He must select and evaluate, and in
doing this he is acquiring a power of discrimination that
will be of great value to him later.</p>

<p>The childhood of many famous men of the past was
distinguished by an unusual amount of imitative play,
a free expression of the dramatic instinct. Goethe, in
his memories, speaks lovingly of his early years thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">From my father I have my stature,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">My earnest aim in living;</div>
<div class="verse">From little mother, my joyous nature,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">My love of story weaving.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Continuing, he tells of the tales he heard, and what
they meant to him as he played them:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sometimes I was a prince and sometimes a peasant. Now
I was rewarded for being a bountiful and considerate king,
then punished according to the deserts of a wicked and
revengeful giant; and always as I played these parts I was
learning the unchangeable laws of life.</p>

</div>

<p>What Goethe learned through acting tales his mother
told him, the child of today is learning as he dramatizes
stories, although not always in as great a measure
as was learned by the author of <i>Faust</i> and <i>Werther</i>.
But he is learning according to his ability and within
his limitations. When he has played the part, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
laws involved in it become fixed principles with him,
and a big step is taken in the direction of his moral
training. Because of a growing recognition of this
truth the present strong interest in dramatization in
schools is becoming general throughout the country.
Teachers are beginning to realize that they can give
no more eloquent sermon on truthtelling than to tell
the story of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” and then
let the children dramatize it. There is no more effective
means of giving a lesson in contentment than
presenting the tale of the pig who thought his life hard
and leading the boys and girls to play it.</p>

<p>Therefore it follows that dramatization should be
encouraged, and to be most far-reaching in its results,
it should be done by means of story-telling, because by
proceeding from the story to the action the child creates
the play and makes it his own.</p>

<p>There are many books of plays for children, carefully
written and adapted to their interests in word, style,
and theme. But such plays do not mean as much to the
child as those he makes for himself. They are not
as much his own, and consequently they contribute
less toward his growth and development.</p>

<p>The natural way is for the child to hear the story and
then act it. Therefore every story-teller should have
in his possession a number of tales with dramatic possibilities.
He should tell one of these vividly and dramatically,
using much dialogue, and then, while it is
still fresh in the minds of the children, encourage
them to play it. It is well to use the published plays
also, because there are many excellent ones, but the
narrator should read them over, get the plot, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the story, before putting them into the hands of the
children.</p>

<p>Shall dialogue be dictated by the story-teller and the
children drilled in their parts? No. Conversation
used in telling the tale will suggest to the children
what to say, and they will make up their own parts.
They must be led and directed, but help from the
teacher or leader should be given in such a way that the
children feel they are <i>making</i> the play themselves.
Help them by questions that will lead them to think
and act instead of telling them what to do and say.</p>

<p>Suppose “The Pied Piper of Hamelin” is to be dramatized.
After the story has been told, say to the
children, “Do you want to play it?” Of course
they will want to. Then, by questioning, lead them
to constructive effort.</p>

<p>How many people shall we need? Immediately the
answers will come, and as the different characters are
named make a list, thus getting the cast. Who can
be the mayor, members of the council, the piper, rats,
mothers and fathers, lame boy, etc.?</p>

<p>There will be two divisions, those who are forward,
eager to take a prominent part, and the shy, retiring
ones who will not offer. This latter group must
not be ignored, and to draw its members into the work
requires much tact. Sometimes when it is impossible
to get a child to take a speaking part, he can be encouraged
to be one of a group of “supers,” as they are
called on the professional stage, because although he
lacks the confidence necessary to make him lift his
voice, his diffidence vanishes in doing pantomime with
a number of other children. He will be a rat or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
citizen when he cannot be coaxed or driven into being
the piper, and after many pantomime performances
he gains the confidence in himself that enables him to
take a speaking part.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties incident to dramatization in the
schoolroom is that the same children always clamor to
take the star parts, and sometimes sulk if not permitted
to do so, or sneer at the efforts of others. This
situation must be met as any other problem in discipline
is met, by skill on the part of the teacher and by inculcating
a sense of fairness and courtesy that holds selfishness
in check. Lead the child to see that what gives
him pleasure gives some one else pleasure also, and
that it is the right of each member of the class to experience
that pleasure. Once the boy or girl realizes that
well-bred people are considerate and do not deride the
efforts of others, no matter how imperfect their achievement
may be, the dramatization period loses its greatest
bugbear and shy children do not hesitate to take part
because of fear that they will be laughed at. This
result cannot be brought about instantly, but persistence
and tact will finally accomplish it.</p>

<p>Do not be discouraged because it seems that some of
the shy or less capable children will never take a speaking
part. Sometimes even after they perform in pantomime
they still hang back and will speak only in
chorus. But this last is at least a step in the desired
direction. Keep working them in groups, and gradually
from group speaking they will advance to individual
speaking. Sometimes this process is slow and
discouraging, but the teacher should remember that
mental development is never a mushroom growth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and that great achievement is not wrought in a day.
The marble block yields so slowly to the shaping of the
sculptor’s chisel that sometimes it seems it never will
take the form he visions for it, but ceaseless effort
always brings results. So it is with the teacher in
molding human material. Results are sure to come if
persistence and patience are unflagging and faith is
deep and strong. It is worth much for a shy, self-conscious
child to grow to the point where he can lose
himself in the rôle of a play, and no matter how crudely
he does it, he should be encouraged and given frequent
opportunities to express himself, because as a means of
self-development his crude performance is of as much
value as the artistic one of the talented child, although
it may be less enjoyable to spectators.</p>

<p>With little children especially, it is desirable to use
some play whose cast will include every member of the
class. It gives the eager child a chance to be “in it,”
as children say, and makes it easier to draw the diffident
child to participate, because he wants to do what
all the others are doing. “The Pied Piper” is ideal
for this, because of the flexibility of groups. There can
be enough rats, parents, children, or council members
to include twenty or forty children, and the larger the
groups the more intense the interest.</p>

<p>After the cast is decided upon, plan the scenes, again
by questioning the children. What is the first thing to
be done and where is it done? Thus, by question and
suggestion, work up the lines. In other words, have
the children create the parts themselves and they will
play them spontaneously. The production may not be
highly artistic, but it will have greater educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
value than one worked out by an adult and merely
acted by the children. After it has been created in this
way it may be put into finished permanent form.
Little children may practice it until they memorize
the lines, while those in the grammar grades may
write parts, thus making a play that can be used many
times. This sort of work is very valuable, and may
form a composition or language exercise that will be
enjoyed by the class.</p>

<p>Another method is to have the various members suggest
lines to be spoken by the different characters and
choose the best for the play. Sometimes a child who
does little in the usual composition work and never
gets a high mark, will suggest an excellent line or
sentence, and to have it go into the play is a tremendous
joy to him, especially if he doubts his own ability.
Another plan that makes the class interest keen, is for
each member to plan or write a scene, and without the
members knowing the authorship of the various papers,
have them read, and select the best by vote, whereupon
the name of the writer is revealed. This method can
be used in writing parts for one character or for all the
characters, and in several other ways that will be of
much value to the children.</p>

<p>Of course the teacher or leader must be the guiding
spirit, because a well-built, correctly proportioned plot
is necessary. But her suggestion should be chiefly
by way of question, leaving the children to feel that they,
and not the instructor, are doing the work, although in
reality the teacher’s judgment is the foundation upon
which the structure stands, and she must use it in building
the play just as she uses it in telling the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>For little people there are many stories with dramatic
possibilities, some of which may be acted wholly in
pantomime, some with combined pantomime and
spoken parts, and others entirely of spoken parts.
In working with foreign children it is well to begin with
pantomime plays, as the child who knows he cannot
express himself easily in English will always balk at
taking a speaking part. Some of Æsop’s fables lend
themselves particularly well to pantomime, especially
“The Lion and the Mouse,” “The Fox and the Grapes,”
“The Dog and His Shadow,” and “The Hare and the
Tortoise.” <i>The Dramatic Festival</i>, by Craig, and <i>Festivals
and Plays</i>, by Chubb, give valuable suggestions
for pantomime work, as well as a list of plays adapted
to it, and the worker with older children will also find
these books to be excellent guides.</p>

<p>There is an equally large amount of material for dramatic
work with older children. <i>Hiawatha</i> never fails
to delight fourth and fifth grade boys and girls. <i>Robin
Hood</i> in dramatic form is loved even more than in story,
as are some of the exploits of King Arthur and his
knights and of Pwyll, the hero of the Mabinogion. Any
of these tales may be carried out simply or may be
worked into elaborate performances with costumes and
stage settings. If the latter be the choice, much pleasure
and useful experience will come to the children
through making the properties. Any boy who can
whittle can fashion spears and swords, and gold and
silver paper is wonderfully effective in supplying
glitter. Does a knight need colored hose to be in keeping
with his doublet? Let him borrow a pair of his
mother’s or sister’s white ones and coat them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
blackboard crayon of the desired hue. One laundering
will make them spotless again, and there is no outlay of
money for something that must be discarded at the end
of the performance. Helmets, shields, and pilgrim
hats can be made by the manual-training boys, and
girls in the domestic-science class will enjoy sewing the
costumes.</p>

<p>The teacher in the ungraded school is particularly
fortunate in opportunities for this kind of work, because
she can correlate it with other subjects in ways that
workers in schools using the departmental system cannot
do. One country teacher had her eighth-grade
history class give a pageant portraying the French exploration
in the Mississippi Valley. The class devoted
a term to the preparation; the subject was made the
nucleus of their reading, language, history, and manual
work, and the results were most gratifying. Boys
who never had written a readable paper did some
astonishingly good work in composition because of
their interest in the play and their desire to contribute
to it, and the standard of class scholarship
was raised, to say nothing of the joy the children
derived from it.</p>

<p>Many other historical subjects are equally rich in
possibilities. The Spanish exploration in Florida, the
Dutch in New York, the Spanish settlement of California,
the framing and adoption of the Declaration of
Independence, John Smith and Pocahontas, Ponce de
Leon seeking the fountain of youth, the story of Columbus,
and many similar themes afford good opportunities
for class play-making and correlation of school
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_TWELVE">CHAPTER TWELVE<br />
<span class="smcap">Bible Stories</span></h3>

<p>One of the glaring defects of our modern educational
system is that almost no provision is made
for the study of the Bible as a great classic, and as a
result boys and girls complete grammar and high-school
courses without sufficient knowledge of the epic of the
Hebrews to enable them to understand the world’s
best literature. The myths of Greece and Rome are
studied because of their cultural value, yet from universities
throughout the country comes the complaint that
many of the works of famous authors are beyond the
enjoyment of students because the Biblical allusions
have no meaning for them. What should be as familiar
as “Red Riding Hood” and “Cinderella” is known in
name only, and the immortal book is regarded as a
repository of golden texts and maxims instead of as
a glorious artistic creation.</p>

<p>The masses of children know almost nothing of the
story of Israel, because outside of the Sunday school
and the exceptional home, it is rarely told. Yet educators
emphasize its need in the intellectual as well as in
the spiritual development of the child, and declare that
the Old Testament tales should be as much a part of
the school curriculum as are the myths of Greece and
Rome and the northland. Rein, the great German
educator, advocates using them in the third and fourth
grades to the exclusion of all others, which is done in
the state schools of Baden, while in America Dr. G.
Stanley Hall pleads eloquently in behalf of Bible
stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“To eliminate the Bible from education,” says this
famous psychologist, “is as preposterous pedagogically
as it would have been in the days of Plato to taboo
Homer from the education of Greek youth. It is not
only a model of English, but it is impossible to understand
the culture history of Europe without it, as it
has influenced the literature, history, and life of Western
nations as no other book has begun to do.”</p>

<p>The secular narrator, as well as the teacher of
religion, should use the Bible tales freely, that men
and women of the future may have a broader knowledge
of literature, history, and life than they can have
without them. This is no impossible task, even for
the amateur, because the Biblical narratives are perfect
ones for telling. Nowhere else in literature do we
find such thrilling tales of adventure, such exquisite
idylls, such sublime ballads, such annals of high purpose
and noble achievement, as in the epic of Israel. Nowhere
else are there more spectacular, perfectly constructed
plots. Ruskin said, “It would be pre-eminently
the child’s book even though it had no
religious value above other books”; and Dr. Fuchs of
Vienna declares that we might, if we lacked material,
give children nothing but Bible stories and yet satisfy
every craving of their natures, because the Bible contains
every type of tale that appeals to the child.
From Genesis to Revelation it is an incomparable
record of human desire, human endeavor, human failure,
and human success. In the Old Testament we find
myth, fairy tale, fable, romance, legend, and history,
told in simple, elemental beauty by the Hebrew story-tellers,
tinged with that varied color and imagery so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
characteristic of oriental literature and so fascinating
to children,—stories that, as Mrs. Houghton says,
“are the product of a child nation, and therefore very
close to the heart of the child.”</p>

<p>The Old Testament, rather than the New, is the child’s
storybook, because it is the expression of a primitive
people, and its tales picture primitive, rugged heroes
that boys and girls can understand, whereas the second
division of the Bible, except that portion centering
around the childhood and boyhood of Christ, is adult
in character. But it is a mistake to think that all Old
Testament tales can be presented with gratifying results.
To tell the story of Ruth and Boaz to tiny tots
would be as absurd as to give them the <i>Decameron</i>
of Boccaccio or Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>, because the characters
and incidents are remote from their interest. In using
material from the Bible, as from any other source, it
is necessary to keep in mind the story interests of childhood,
and to remember that the skeletons of tales, not
the style and vocabulary in which they are written,
must be the test for selection. If the framework is
suited to the period of mental development, the language
can be adapted, while otherwise no amount of
simplifying can bring it within the understanding and
powers of enjoyment.</p>

<p>The Old Testament is particularly rich in stories for
children, because it was formulated in a period when the
Hebrew nation was a child nation. The men and
women of Israel were grown to adult stature, but they
had the hearts of children. They thought concretely,
as the child thinks, and consequently their literary
expression is concrete and illustrative. This, added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the facts that they, like all other orientals, loved the
story and brought it to a high artistic point, and that the
Old Testament heroes are not refined to the point of
æstheticism, but are strong, rugged, elemental men,
thoroughly human and far removed from goody-goodies,
makes it an ideal book for the child. Gideon
and Joshua possess virtues, but they possess faults also.
They are punished and they are rewarded, and because
they have much in common with children, the lessons
learned through their victories and defeats are more
valuable than a thousand admonitions.</p>

<p>In advocating the use of Bible stories a word of
caution seems necessary, lest the narrator, actuated
by the laudable desire to enrich the intellectual and
spiritual life of the child, may harm instead of benefit.
The Hebrew people were in a state of advanced barbarism
when their tribal achievements grew into an
epic, and the deeds of their heroes are often so bloodthirsty
and revengeful that they cannot be reconciled
with modern views. Boys and girls are quick to
realize this, and consequently many of the Old Testament
tales must be softened by the elimination of
objectionable features, just as many fairy and epical
tales must be softened.</p>

<p>Nor are gore and revenge the only elements we must
cut away from these old tales. Those who give the
narrative of Israel to boys and girls of twelve and
fourteen should be careful to eliminate from it everything
that may be suggestive of the vulgar, for which,
at this age, many children are on the lookout. It is
better to omit than to veil and modify questionable
portions of a tale, because young people are very discerning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and to see through gossamer is to arouse
curiosity. Dr. Bodley cites instances of youths in the
romantic period reading the Bible because of lewd
thoughts. This danger leads some persons to decry
the use of Bible stories by the average narrator, in
whose hands they believe them to be dangerous.
However, if he uses judgment, if he makes it a rule
to omit whatever awakens a doubt in his mind, even
the amateur may tell Bible stories with beneficial
results. It is possible to eliminate from many an
Old Testament narrative without breaking the thread
of the story, just as it is possible to give boys and girls
a clear idea of the man Chopin without introducing
the George Sand episode. So much of the Old Testament
is pure adventure tale that the story-teller may
use the portion that feeds the elemental hero love
without touching upon what might arouse morbid
curiosity or desire, or that which sanctions gore and
revenge.</p>

<p>Those who have not had training in gathering and
adapting story material from the Bible will be aided
greatly in their work by Frances Jenkins Olcott’s
book, <i>Bible Stories to Read and Tell</i>. Miss Olcott gives
the stories as they are given in the King James Version,
preserving all the beauty of language of the Hebrew
story-tellers, but she has excluded everything that
might prove objectionable; and with this book as a
guide there is little danger of making a mistake in
telling the Hebrew hero tales to children.</p>

<p>Bible stories should be graded as carefully as fairy
stories are graded. In choosing for little children, select
those whose heroes are children, and give to the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
who craves the heroic the incomparable tales of the
Hebrew wanderers, those men whose lives were a varied
succession of adventures. For the child of each period
there is a wealth of material. The stories of the baby
Moses, little Samuel, the boy Joseph, the boy Timothy,
the boy David, and the baby Isaac are very appealing
to six- and seven-year-olds. They love also to hear of
the mother and the baby Samson, of Ishmael and Hagar,
and those other mothers and babies of long ago, and
especially dear to them is the story of the Babe of Bethlehem.
This lovely narrative is a part of the birthright
of every child, and is exquisite enough to merit
careful preparation on the part of the story-teller.
The Bible itself should be the storehouse to which the
narrator goes for material, but those not especially
gifted in visualizing and imagination will derive much
help from the work of modern literary artists who have
told again the story of the Christ Child. The eleventh
and twelfth chapters of the first book of <i>Ben Hur</i>, the
creation of a man whose reverence was as great as his
talent, should be re-read by every one who attempts to
tell of the song and the star in Judea, and the works of
Henry van Dyke, Selma Lagerlöf, and John of Hildesheim
will aid greatly in giving color and atmosphere.
This means time and labor, but no amount of preparation
is too great to put upon the world’s noblest stories.
The narrator should approach them, not arrogantly,
and satisfied of his ability to tell them because he has
known them from childhood, but as the artist approaches
the masterpiece he aspires to copy, willing to
labor that he may be worthy of the task, willing to read
them over and over again and count each reading a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
return to the fount of inspiration. This should be the
attitude toward all great stories, but especially toward
the immortal ones of the Bible.</p>

<p>For the child in the heroic period the Old Testament
is a gold mine, and it is a pity that its superb adventure
tales are so little used by story-tellers, since they are so
fascinating to boys and girls. Even when told as
separate stories they arouse interest and hold the attention,
but they are most valuable when given in a sequence,
because then the child regards the Old Testament
as a great human drama, the epic of a people.</p>

<p>A good plan is to begin with the call of Abraham, as
related in the twelfth chapter of Genesis. Picture the
patriarch, with Lot and Sarah, going into exile out of
the land of Haran, through Canaan to the plain of
Moreh, building there the altar under the soothsayer’s
oak, and journeying southward over the desert to Egypt.
Tell of the banishment by Pharaoh and the return to
Bethel, of the strife between the herdsmen and the survey
of the land, of the captivity and rescue of Lot.
Paint vividly the highway along which they traveled,
now over the desert, now across the fertile plain skirting
the sea, often footsore and weary, often suffering from
heat and thirst as wanderers in the East suffered, and
the story will cause children to turn from the cheap
adventure tale of today as music lovers turn from
ragtime to a Chopin prelude.</p>

<p>Then there are tales of those other Old Testament
wanderers, Isaac, “the Ulysses of the Hebrews,” and
Jacob, whose life was so eventful. Take the boys over
the routes these men traveled. Let them share their
exploits and adventures, resting in fertile places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the wanderers rested, now by the well outside Nahor,
the servants praying beside the kneeling camels as
Bethuel’s lovely daughter came down the hillside with
the pitcher on her shoulder, now moving as the caravan
moved, over roads the Hebrew armies traveled on their
way to war, along which tradesfolk journeyed in times of
peace. There is marvelous color and romance in these
Old Testament thoroughfares, and they are highways of
fascination even today. Still across their yellow sands
turbaned Arabs go up and down, singing praise to Allah
just as men sang to God in the remote time of Israel.
They bear with them skin bags filled with water from
the pools and streams, dates, figs, and dried goat’s
flesh, such as formed the noontide repast of Isaac and
his men, for in the changeless East life is today as it
was in the beginning of things. When the caravans
rest, they sit under the palm trees in some oasis, telling
stories their fathers told, and using the Old Testament
forms of speech. Still in that land of nomads to see
is to “lift up the eyes,” and maidens go to draw water
when the day’s heat is over just as Rebecca went to the
well of Nahor.</p>

<p>The book of Joshua is a glorious adventure story.
The siege and destruction of Jericho, the victories of
Joshua, the slave boy from Egypt who became the first
soldier of the Hebrews, the distribution of Canaan
among the tribes of Israel, and Othniel’s valor and reward
satisfy every desire of the child who craves hero
stories. They satisfy now as they satisfied two thousand
years ago, because they grew out of the life of a
people and run the entire gamut of human emotion as
only racial tales can do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The book of Judges is a collection of incomparable
narratives. The enslavement of Israel by Jabin, the
defeat and death of Sisera, and Gideon’s deliverance and
victory never fail to hold boys and girls who crave
the heroic. Moreover, these stories will arouse interest
in perhaps the finest ode known to any literature, the
song of Deborah in the fifth chapter of Judges. Give
the children some idea of what it has meant to the world.
Ruskin said the memorizing of it in his boyhood shaped
his taste for literature, and Macaulay declared it inspired
him to write “Horatius at the Bridge.” Read
the work of the English poet, and bring out the lovely
pictures in the great Hebrew ode, for it is not fair to
our young people that we allow them to go through
life without knowing this gem, without leading them
to see the beauty of these exquisite words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment
and walk by the way.</p>

<p>They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the
places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous
acts of the Lord.</p>

</div>

<p>Visualize the scenes in those lines: sumptuous,
haughty Hebrews, traveling as only the prosperous
traveled; men in the fine linen of lawgivers, holding
places of power in the land; vagabonds lounging along
the highways, begging alms of passers-by; husbandmen
tilling fields far from the sound of conflict; men in
every walk of life, widely separated by material conditions,
yet brothers in a common weal, rejoicing in a
common blessing, the victory of Barak over the foe of
Israel. It is as rich in color as a canvas by Titian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
pupils in the upper grammar grades will grow to love it
if it is presented as it should be, through the medium of
the story.</p>

<p>The books of Samuel, with their tales of Saul and of
David, of the shepherd boy from the Hebron hills
making music for Israel’s king, his meeting and slaying
Goliath, Saul and the Witch of Endor, and all the eventful
life of David are glorious materials for the story-teller.
Here again inspiration may be obtained from
the work of a modern writer. Browning’s “Saul” will
greatly aid the narrator in telling the story of the boy
David, for the picture the poet gives of the afflicted
monarch in his tent, the son of Jesse standing beside
him singing the Hebrew gleaning songs, is as vivid as it
is exquisite.</p>

<p>Where can we find a more splendid narrative than
that of Solomon, in the second book of Kings? Where
is the boy or girl who does not delight in listening to the
account of the visit of Hiram, king of Tyre, when two
sumptuous monarchs met; of the collection of materials
and the building of the temple; of the visit of the Queen
of Sheba, the adversity and death of Solomon, and
that succession of events that led to the captivity of
Israel? Here, too, we find the great story of the invasion
of Judah and the destruction of Sennacherib; and
Byron’s poem will vivify this tale just as Browning’s
“Saul” vivifies that of the boy David.</p>

<p>The only reason why children look upon the Bible
as a dull, ponderous book is that they are not familiar
with the Old Testament adventure tales, and it is a
mistake to think that present-day boys and girls will
turn away from them. If playground and settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
workers would give more time and attention to the
stories of the Hebrews, they would have less difficulty
in reaching hoodlumish boys. It is necessary to use
tact in presentation,—“sense,” as Lilian Bell says,
“of the brand commonly known as horse,”—for to
preface a narrative with, “Now I shall tell you a Bible
story,” might mean an insurrection. The only way is
to bring the hero on the stage and tell his tale so vividly
that the listeners are held by it to the end. After they
come to know such men as Gideon and Joshua, they
will regard the Bible as a great storybook.</p>

<p>A settlement worker had this experience not long ago.
She told the tale of Joshua to a group of young ruffians,
who sat through it as if held by a spell, and at its conclusion
the leader of the band remarked, “That was
some story!” Other Old Testament heroes were then
introduced with excellent effect, and the lads were
amazed to learn that the Bible contained such stories.
But results of this kind cannot be obtained without
effort and preparation on the part of the raconteur.</p>

<p>Bible stories, being the perfect tales of the world,
should be told as nearly as possible in the language and
style in which they were written. Some modification
is necessary for the purpose of clarifying, but the Biblical
expressions should be used frequently. Quote freely
from the original or follow the story with a Bible reading,
that the child who hears the tales may catch something
of the majestic beauty of expression of the Hebrew
story-tellers. There can be no more pitiful mistake than
to tell these matchless narratives in the vernacular of
the street. To use modern slang in recounting the
wanderings of Isaac or the passing of the Children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Israel through the Red Sea is to profane a marvelous
artistic creation, even though it had no religious significance,
and unfortunately story-tellers sometimes do
this, thinking they will make the tales more interesting
to children. That sort of narration will amuse and hold
young folk only as long as it lasts, and leaders of children
are not working merely for the here and now. Their
effort is for time and eternity, and they should have
sufficient vision to see beyond the present, sufficient
sense of proportion to estimate values. The Old
Testament tales need no modern strokes to make them
attractive, because they abound in color and incidents
that lead to superb climaxes, and never fail to fascinate
when given with sincerity. Therefore they should be
told in simple, dignified language, as the men of Israel
told them when the world was young, and while they
fire the imagination, they will lead children unconsciously
to an appreciation of beautiful English, which
is one of the cardinal aims of every story-teller who is
worthy of the name.</p>

<p>The teller of Bible stories should draw from music
and art, as well as from literature, because to follow a
tale with a picture or musical number inspired by it is
to heighten enjoyment and strengthen the impression
already made. If children see Bendemann’s masterpiece,
“By the Waters of Babylon,” after they have
heard the story of the captivity of Israel, they will have
a sympathy for the exiled Hebrews that they cannot
have otherwise. Saul, David, and many other Old
Testament heroes will seem more than ever like living,
breathing men when viewed as Michelangelo portrayed
them, while Giulio Romano’s frescoes, “The Story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Joseph,” or Pellafrino da Modena’s “Story of Solomon,”
will intensify their color and romance and help
to lead to an appreciation of art. Cheap reproductions
bring these and other masterpieces within the reach of
the narrator, and he should travel every bypath in
which he may glean materials that will help children
to love these old tales. He should keep ever before
him the thought of how they have enriched the world,
and how powerfully lives are influenced by stories
heard in childhood. When Bertel Thorwaldsen was a
blue-eyed boy in Copenhagen, he heard a tale that long
afterward became the inspiration of “The Lion of
Lucerne,” and young Richard Wagner, playing in a
Dresden street one day, crept into a group to which a
strolling bard was telling the medieval legend of “Parsifal.”
It was a seed planted in a creative mind, and
years afterward it flowered in two noble operas of the
Holy Grail. So it was with Goethe, with Browning,
with Byron, and many other great men. Perhaps in
your group of youthful hearers there may be a boy or a
girl who will listen as gifted children of the past have
listened to an old, old story, and perhaps your telling
it may result, long after your work is ended, in his giving
to some branch of art a creation that will enrich the
world through generations yet to come. But even
though there be no budding genius among your auditors,
sincere, artistic telling of the Bible stories cannot fail to
produce great results. It will develop the emotional nature
of the average child; it will broaden his sympathy
and increase his capacity for feeling, make him more sympathetic,
more responsive to the joys and sorrows of his
fellow men, and better fitted to become a useful citizen.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_THIRTEEN">CHAPTER THIRTEEN<br />
<span class="smcap">Story-Telling and the Teaching of Ethics</span></h3>

<p>The function of education is not only to give the
child knowledge and a capacity for acquiring
further knowledge that shall equip him for the life
struggle and make success a possible attainment,
but also to give him an ethical standard that shall
make him fit to live among his fellows and a respect
for the rights and feelings of others, or, as Goethe
says in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, “Reverence for what is above,
reverence for what is beneath, reverence for what is
equal.” He must be taught to realize that he is part
of a great unit and that individual desires must often
give way to the welfare of the many. He must be
taught that as an individual he owes to society obedience
to the laws that govern society and allegiance
to the principles that make possible a harmonious
family, civic, and national life. Consequently it is
required of every teacher that she give ethical instruction,
that she endeavor to bring children to an understanding
of what is generally accepted as right and
wrong, and implant in them convictions strong enough to
cause them to adhere to those standards.</p>

<p>In establishing ethical standards, as in establishing
standards in art, literature, or music, we must appeal to
the emotional side of the child as well as to the intellectual
side. We must lead him to feel that the right
act is the one that he wants to do, and this cannot
be accomplished by a presentation of dry facts and
precepts. Every teacher knows that the time spent
in admonishing a child what he <i>ought</i> to do brings no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
gratifying results. He is not swayed to repugnance
for one act or to admiration for another by being
told “Thou shalt,” or “Thou shalt not.” At the time
the command is given, fear may cause him to obey
it; but conduct that is the result of force does not
strengthen the character or teach high standards of
action. It tends instead to harden the child and make
him determined to act differently at the first opportunity.
Ethical training does not mean to attempt
to control the child, but to enlighten him and direct
his volition to the point where he will attempt to control
himself. As Ella Lyman Cabot says, “Its aim is to
make the best there is so inviting to the child that he
will work eagerly and persistently to win it.” The
ideal that is held up to him must be so beautiful that
he will be willing to sacrifice and endure hardship in
order to attain to it, and through story-telling he may
be led to see this ideal more vividly than in any other
way, because the story makes right acts appealing
and wrong acts repugnant. Moreover, through the
narrator’s art the child lives the experiences of the tales
he hears. He suffers with the evildoer and is rewarded
with the virtuous, and because he is powerfully moved
by a narrative, his character is lastingly affected by it.</p>

<p>In giving ethical instruction, it is necessary to use
the right material. Tales selected for this purpose
should be suited to the child’s particular period of
mental development, they should contain a lesson the
boy or the girl ought to learn, and they should be strong
and virile and true to life. Much harm is done by telling
stories of unusually good children. Such young
folk are unpopular with boys and girls, and the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
about them is as distasteful as is the “goody-goody”
that is met with in real life. Instead of being an
influence toward commendable action and the acceptance
of a higher standard of right and wrong, the
over-idealistic tale antagonizes the child and goads
him toward that from which we would have him
veer aside. Perhaps this accounts for the fact that
girls often enjoy boys’ stories more than those written
especially for girls. The normal girl wants to read
and hear about live, natural young folk, and the heroine
who has drawing-room manners and nothing else is
very far from her ideal. Story characters that influence
children must be human, full of human faults
and virtues. From their failures and successes young
people will learn many valuable lessons, but they will
learn no lesson from one who poses as an unnatural
young saint.</p>

<p>Moral training should begin with the babe, and therefore
the mother and primary teacher need stories that
have ethical values as early as they need Mother Goose
tales and jingles. Very early in life the child must
be brought to realize that there is a higher law than
that of its own will or desire. It must be taught
obedience, cleanliness, kindness to animals, consideration
for the rights of others, truthfulness, industry,
honesty, and courtesy, and these lessons can be
inculcated more effectively by means of story-telling
than in any other way. The tale of “The Little Red
Hen” doing the work and reaping the reward of her
labor is a sermon on industry that little people do not
forget. The story of the farmer boy who rolled the
stone out of the highway because he feared it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
cause injury to some one, and then of the compensation
that came to him at the hands of the lord of the village
who placed it there, will help to make children thoughtful
and kindly.</p>

<p>In telling stories of this type, the narrator should
emphasize the fact that the greatest reward is the
mental satisfaction that follows a good action, because
the child who hears much of material reward sometimes
thinks chiefly of the money or picnic or good time
commendable conduct may bring, and if it happens
that he does not receive remuneration, decides it is
useless to perform good deeds. A case of this kind
that came under my observation was that of a boy
in a country school, a lazy, thoughtless little fellow.
One day when a man drove through the school yard,
his brother, who was very considerate, ran to open the
gate. The stranger tossed a penny to the child, and
the teacher, thinking to give a lasting lesson in consideration
to the thoughtless boy, dwelt at length upon
the stick of candy the money would buy. Several
days later another man drove through the school
yard and the thoughtless boy ran to open the gate.
He received a smile and a “Thank you” but no money,
and he could not be persuaded to open the gate again.</p>

<p>It is well to give stories in which children are materially
rewarded, but they should be taught to see that
material reward is not the only reward, and that desire
for it should not be the motive that prompts a
good action. The fireman who risks his life in saving
the property or life of another is not bountifully paid,
and seldom does he receive a purse for bravery. But
he is true to his duty. He is giving to society the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
thing that he owes it, service, and his greatest guerdon
is the satisfaction that comes from being steadfast to a
trust. Examples of this kind are of great value to the
child who is inclined to be selfish, and they are very
effective in bringing all children to realize the truth
of Alice Cary’s words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There are no fairy folk who ride about the world at night,</div>
<div class="verse">To give you rings and other things to pay for doing right,</div>
<div class="verse">But if you’ll do to others what you’d have them do to you,</div>
<div class="verse">You’ll be as blest as if the best of fairy tales were true.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Very young children can be taught to realize that
the true reward of right conduct comes from added self-respect
and from winning the esteem of others, and
whenever a child is given a tale in which a boy or a girl
receives some wonderful treasure for kindness or
courtesy or truthfulness, the narrator will do well to
interpolate a sentence like this: “And the best part
of it was that Albert was happy because he had done
what was right. That thought gave him a glad feeling
even more than the big, shiny dollar.”</p>

<p>Many fairy tales and fables are of particular ethical
value for little children, and the narrator can draw
much from the field of general literature; biography
and history hold many good examples, while the Bible
is a rich storehouse of material. Ella Lyman Cabot’s
excellent work, <i>Ethics for Children</i>, discusses the
ethical side of story-telling in such a detailed and
complete way that it should be in the hands of every
mother and teacher. The book gives valuable suggestions,
not only to workers with little folk, but to those
who have the training of grammar grade and high-school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
pupils also. Carolyn Sherwin Bailey’s <i>Stories
for Sunday Telling</i> contains some good material for
the mother and the primary teacher, while the several
books by Sara Cone Bryant (listed in <a href="#CHAPTER_SEVEN">Chapter Seven</a>,
“Telling the Story”) will be helpful.</p>

nothing drives home with more force a lesson in patriotism,

has triumphed. Dozens of characters worth emulating

<span class="smcap">Story-Telling to Intensify Interest in History</span></h3>

<p>It has been said by Walter Prichard Eaton, “The
pupil who gets a mark of one hundred and thereafter
hates Shakespeare, has failed—rather, his teacher
has,”—and it is equally true that the instructor also
has failed whose classes look upon history as a series
of dates and dull facts instead of a colorful story.</p>

<p>To teach history successfully means to give the
child vivid pictures of the past, to enable him to see
as a whole the march of a race or of a nation across
the canvas of time, to watch the legions of warriors
go to victory or defeat, to hear the voices of statesmen
whose wisdom has builded empires, to walk side by
side with the men and women whose lives make up the
annals of the world. To be of value to the child,
history must be felt, just as a work of literature must
be felt. He must live it, must approve the worthy
and disapprove the unworthy, must rejoice in and
sympathize with the fortunes and misfortunes of its
characters, else it cannot be anything more to him than
the chronology in the almanac, disliked during his
school days and forgotten as soon as they are over.</p>

<p>Story-telling can make history alive and vital because
of its power to convey the child to distant scenes and
ages, and through it he may become, not only a spectator,
but a participant in every human activity. If
our libraries were to be swept away and publishing
houses should shut their doors, we could still teach
history to children, and teach it successfully, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the art of the narrator. By the medium of the story
we can make the child see what has been done by
his ancestors and other people in the past; by it we
can interpret to him how his forefathers lived and
acted, how other people have attempted to do what he
is trying to do or sees done, and give him a vivid idea
of human ways of living and conduct. This is history
in the larger sense, and it was taught successfully
by the story-teller in the past.</p>

<p>Before the days of printing, when books were manuscripts
that no one but monks could read and kings
could afford to own, story-telling was the only way
in which this subject was taught. Tales of bygone
days were told in castle halls and to groups of eager
listeners on the village green, and boys and girls of
King Alfred’s time knew as much of their country’s
story from the lips of wandering bards as those of our
generation know from cramming the contents of
textbooks. They knew it because through the tales
they heard they were able to relive it, and what has
been done before can be done again. Because of the
story’s power to vivify, modern children can relive
the world’s story just as those in medieval times relived
it, and history can be made a subject fraught with
delight to the child.</p>

<p>Child attention centers first upon familiar things, and
radiates from them to the unknown. Through his
interest in creatures that are a part of his environment,
the kindergarten tot becomes interested in those of
other regions, in the men, women, children, and animals
that are part of the life of some other child. Through
knowledge of his immediate surroundings he comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to acquire knowledge of life in other surroundings,
and according to the appeal it makes to his imagination,
he understands and sympathizes with it, and his social
sense is broadened. Therefore, in the study of history,
the attention should be focused upon local environment,
and from it should radiate to other sections of
the world. In other words, by what the child sees
happening around him, he must be led to see what has
happened in the past and what is happening now in
distant regions. This requires imagination, and a
boy or a girl cannot see or feel these events if they are
presented as a dry chronology, because under those
conditions they do not arouse the imagination. He
must behold them flashed on a canvas like a colorful
picture, and because the story can do this, because
it can make real to the imagination situations that
cannot be experienced, through it he can be led to see
and feel all that we desire him to see and feel.</p>

<p>The biographical story, the tale of the leader who
towers above his fellows like the Matterhorn above
the Valais foothills, is a boon to every teacher of history.
Because it is unified in plot and dramatic in appeal
to the imagination, it is the most easily handled of
all the history material, and should be used freely.
But if children are not to have a distorted idea of the
story of the human race, we must not stop with the
biographical tale. We must give them also a conception
of the part the masses have had in the making
of the great human story, of the yeomen of England,
upon whose sturdy shoulders the foundation of British
liberty stands, of the vassals of Italy, France, and
Germany, of the army of unknown toilers who built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Pyramids and the Chinese Wall. Sometimes, in
satisfying the child’s hero-love, we make him one-sided
by laying too much stress upon individual
achievement and not enough upon the work of the
multitude. We do not lead him to value the importance
of the humble who toil in the rank and file. This
is not as it should be. We should make it clear to him
that the stokers who feed the furnace of the man-of-war
are as splendidly patriotic as the admiral who
commands the fleet, and are as necessary to their land,
because, were there no coal heavers, there could be no
navy.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, because martial events are more
spectacular than those of peace, we give the impression
that they are the only important and heroic ones, and
fail to convince the children of the fact that the peasants
of Lorraine, who tilled their fields until they blossomed
like gardens, served their land as loyally as the soldiers
who marched to victory under the oriflamme of Henry
of Navarre. We are too prone to center the child interest
around military affairs, and neglect to emphasize
the importance of conflicts of another kind. The
history of every modern industry, of every achievement
that has meant anything to the world, is a story of
struggle, of victory over opposing forces. It has its
succession of events, its periods of triumph and defeat,
its moments of suspense, and its thrilling climax, and
if presented in all its possibilities, is as fascinating to
childhood as Napoleon’s Russian campaign. Let us
not fail to give these narratives of struggle that are
unstained by human blood, and in doing it lead children
to understand that there are other ways of serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
one’s land besides riding a war horse or carrying a
musket.</p>

<p>We teach that Robert Fulton invented the first
steamboat, but it is only the exceptional child-leader
who makes the most of that event, who throws upon
the canvas, for youth to behold, the story of the struggle
and disappointment, the triumph and despair, of the
young American engineer. To give them the fact
that the <i>Clermont</i> made a successful trip from New
York to Albany in 1807, is like telling the end of a
story without the beginning or intervening chapters,
and a snatch of a tale never has the effect of the whole.
But if the children have all the light and shade of that
splendid narrative of invention, of the labor beside
the Seine, of the hope and discouragement there, it
becomes a fascinating, unforgotten tale. They remember
the <i>Clermont</i> episode because they have enjoyed
a story, and years afterward, when they see a
ferryboat or an ocean greyhound, they will think of
the New Englander through whose dreams and labor
it came to be.</p>

<p>To the teacher who looks upon history as a great,
fascinating tale, who regards it as a narrative instead
of a mere bunch of dates and periods, who knows the
story of man’s inner development as well as that of
his outer, and who uses the myths, legends, and epics
of a land as side lights to illuminate its true story, great
results are possible. There is no phase or period of
history that he cannot make intensely interesting to
the child, no page of the world’s story that will not
teem with life and color to the boy or girl who receives
it from such an instructor. It may be an account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
events in his own land, of happenings in the stern,
white north country or in the opalescent south, it may
be of knights in glittering armor or of serene-faced,
brown-cowled friars, of men from the masses or from
the ranks of the exalted, but it will breathe and pulsate
for him, it will give him the information that he should
receive, and it will give him an understanding that no
memorizing of dates and outlines can give, because he
has lived with those who made history, because he has
suffered, rejoiced, and achieved with them.</p>

<p>Every great historian is more than a recounter of
events of the past. He is an artist who fits himself
into the moods of men and women who lived and accomplished
before his time, puts them into his pages
as creatures of flesh and blood, and gives to their activities
as much freshness and interest as have the
events that happen before our eyes. Motley, Guizot,
Hume, Hallam, Froissart, and our own Parkman,
Lodge, Prescott, and Bancroft created as splendidly
as ever Hugo, Corneille, or Balzac created, because they
endowed characters of fact with as much life as these
other men gave to characters of fiction; and consequently,
with sources rich in inspiration from which
to draw, the teacher who aspires to vivify history by
story-telling is confronted by no hopeless task. He
need only go to the works of the standard historians
for his background, and then, by giving the imagination
sufficient play to supply setting and detail of
situation, he can carry a joyful lesson to the children.
This is well illustrated in the following story of Western
discovery. Children love it and ask to have it told
again and again, while if the bare facts are given them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in outline form, it means little to them. Not every
teacher is gifted to the degree of Miss Hood and can
hope to weave a fact of history into a tale that deserves
to rank as a children’s classic; but every teacher can
put history into story form with enough skill to make it
hold delight for his pupils and cause them to go from
his instruction with a fondness for history, an understanding
of what history really means, which is worth
infinitely more than a thousand dates or outlines
crammed into the mind for an examination or recitation,
or stored there permanently to rust and grow
useless, because they have no meaning, and therefore
no broadening or illuminating effect upon his life.</p>

<h4>THE SEARCH FOR THE SEVEN CITIES</h4>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Margaret Graham Hood</span></p>

<h5><i>The Story of Tejos</i></h5>

<p>In the year 1530, when Nuño de Guzmán was governor
of New Spain, he had an Indian slave of whom he was very
fond and who was likewise fond of his master. He was a
good servant and different in many ways from all the other
slaves in the palace, and it often pleased Nuño de Guzmán
to talk with him.</p>

<p>“Tejos,” said De Guzmán to him one day, “tell me of
your home when you were a boy, and tell me of your father
and mother.”</p>

<p>Then Tejos turned away from his master and stood for a
long time silent.</p>

<p>“Master,” he said at last, “when Tejos was a boy he
lived not in this land, nor was he a slave. His home was in
a land far, far to the northward. My lord, it was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
land. Beyond the home of my father there was yet another
country greater still. In that farther land were seven great
cities, and even the smallest of them was as great as this
city of Mexico. So rich were the people of those cities that
they made arrowheads of emeralds, and scraped the sweat
from their bodies with scrapers made of gold, and put precious
stones over their doors. Their houses were wide and
high. My father carried to these people the feathers that
they wore upon their heads, and in return they gave him
gold and turquoises and emeralds. My father took Tejos
with him twice, my lord, when he journeyed with feathers
to those cities, and though Tejos was then but a small boy,
he still remembers the long streets where were only the
stores of jewelers who sold the precious stones and made
them into ornaments for the people.”</p>

<p>“And where,” asked Nuño de Guzmán breathlessly,
“where is this land?”</p>

<p>“It is far away from here, my lord,” answered Tejos,
sadly. “Forty days you must journey to reach it, and the
land through which you must travel is a desert lying between
two seas, and there is neither water nor food to be had.”</p>

<p>Scarcely waiting to sleep, De Guzmán began to gather a
force to march in search of this wonderful land. Far and
wide the story spread and on all sides the talk was of</p>

<h5><i>The Land of the Seven Cities</i></h5>

<p>With four hundred Spaniards and twenty thousand
Indians, De Guzmán marched from Mexico, and the people
waited each day to hear that he had conquered a great
empire in the north.</p>

<p>As he went, rumors of the Seven Cities kept coming to
him, and his men were often so excited he could hardly get
them to sleep enough. For days they pressed eagerly forward,
hoping each day to find the Seven Cities at hand; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
instead of this, the country each day grew more desolate,
the mountains grew steeper and the roads harder to find,
while the Seven Cities, instead of coming nearer, were always
farther and farther to the north.</p>

<p>Then the Indians began to desert and the Spaniards to
complain. “We have been deceived,” they said, “and we
shall all die in this bleak land. Let us return to Mexico.”</p>

<p>For a while Nuño de Guzmán cheered them by holding
ever before them the reward that awaited them, but at last
he too grew discouraged and afraid; they all turned about
and marched sadly back to Mexico.</p>

<p>“We will go back now,” said Nuño de Guzmán, “but some
day I will have the right sort of an army and I will come
again. Tejos himself shall lead me, and I will yet find and
conquer those Seven Cities.”</p>

<p>But when he returned to Mexico, Tejos was dead, and
the story of Nuño de Guzmán’s misfortunes discouraged
others; so for six years no one went to seek the Seven Cities.
Then a strange thing happened.</p>

<h5><i>The Wanderings of Cabeza de Vaca</i></h5>

<p>Into the town of Culiacan there one day came wandering
four strange men. They were barefooted and almost
naked. The little clothing they wore was made of skins
and hung in rags about them. Their hair lay in a tangled
mass upon their shoulders, and their beards reached almost
to their knees.</p>

<p>They fell at the feet of the first Spaniard they met, crying,
“Thank God! Thank God! At last! At last!”
Then they seized his hands and kissed them, kissed each
other, and danced about, clapping their hands and shouting
for joy.</p>

<p>“They are madmen,” said the people who gathered
around to look at them. “What shall we do with them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no,” cried the oldest of the strangers. “No, no!
You do not understand. We are poor wanderers who have
been lost for years among the Indians. We have been
slaves; our companions have died, but at last we have
escaped and now, for the first time in years, we see Christians
and Spaniards and our joy overcomes us. Can you
wonder at it, dear friends?”</p>

<p>“Lost among the Indians!” murmured the people in
astonishment. “Made slaves by the Indians! Terrible!
What can it mean?”</p>

<p>“There is something very strange about it,” said one.</p>

<p>“Let us take them before our Capitán,” said another,
and they took them at once to the Capitán.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked rudely, looking with disgust
at their dirt and rags.</p>

<p>“I am Cabeza de Vaca,” said the oldest man. “I am a
noble of Castile who came with Narvaez to conquer Florida.
The fleet was wrecked and all were lost save these three
companions and me. We have been all these years since
among the Indians.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe a word of it,” said the Capitán. “There
is something strange about it. These men may be criminals.
Put them into prison until we find out.”</p>

<p>For three months they lay in the prison. Then they
were sent for by the Alcalde Melchior Diaz. He received
them with all kindness, and to him they were allowed to
tell their story.</p>

<p>“Is it true,” he said to the oldest man, “that you are
Cabeza de Vaca of Castile?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” answered Cabeza de Vaca. “Ten years ago
I sailed with Narvaez to the Florida coast to take part in
his great expedition, but, alas! all our ships were wrecked
and only a few of us escaped to the mainland. There most
of those who did escape died, and we four, three of us Spaniards
and one a negro, have wandered ever since among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Indians. We wept for joy at sight of our own people when
we reached your town, but they have treated us worse
than did the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Do not think of that now,” said kind Melchior Diaz.
“It was a mistake; you shall now be treated with all the
kindness that is your due. Tell me your story.”</p>

<p>Then Cabeza de Vaca began the story of his wanderings:</p>

<p>“After Narvaez and the ships were lost,” said he, “we
escaped to the mainland and were taken captive by the
Indians. They were a poor, starved people who lived on
roots and berries and whatever they could get, and who
often went for days without a mouthful. I do not know
how many years they held us as slaves, but it was for many
years and our sufferings were great.</p>

<p>“We tried always to get to the north, and little by little
we got further westward and northward.</p>

<p>“At last we escaped from those Indians who held us as
slaves and fell in with others farther west who had never
seen a white man. We had with us a rattle such as is used
by their medicine men, and this, with our beards, made them
think we were from heaven. They fell on their faces before
us and gave us all that they had.</p>

<p>“We told these people we wished to go to where the sun
sets, and they said, ‘No, you cannot go there. The people
are too far away.’</p>

<p>“‘It makes no difference,’ I said, ‘you must still lead us
there.’</p>

<p>“We saw they were in great fear, but at last they sent off
two of their women to see if they could find the other people
and tell them of our coming. In five days they came back.
‘They have found no people,’ said the Indians to us. ‘Then,’
said I, ‘lead us to the northward,’ and again they said:
‘There are no people there. Neither is there food or
water.’</p>

<p>“At this I became offended and went apart from them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and at night went away by myself to sleep. But they
came at once where I was and remained all night without
sleep. They talked to me in great fear, telling me how
great was their fright, begging us to be no longer angry;
and they said they would lead us whatsoever way we
wished to go, though they knew they should die on the
way.</p>

<p>“We still pretended to be angry, lest their fright should
leave them, and while we were thus pretending a remarkable
thing happened: the very next day many of them became
ill, and eight men died. They believed we had caused
their death by willing it, and it seemed as if they must all
die of fear.</p>

<p>“In truth, it caused us so much pain to see them suffer
that it could not be greater, and we prayed to God, our
Lord, to relieve them, and they soon got better.</p>

<p>“News of our strange power spread through the land, and
the people trembled at our coming. Sometimes they would
come to meet us, and bring all they owned and offer it to
us. Or, again, when they heard we were coming, they would
go into their houses and pile all their goods in a heap in the
middle of the floor for us, and then sit down, with their
faces to the wall, their heads bowed, and their hair drawn
over their eyes. Thus they waited until we came and spoke
to them. Then they gave us whatever we would take from
them.</p>

<p>“Wherever we went, they brought their sick to us and
begged us to cure them. We always examined them carefully,
and treated them as best we knew how, and prayed
earnestly to God to help us, and they nearly always got well.
Whenever a sick man got well, he not only gave us all that
he had, but all his friends did likewise.</p>

<p>“As we pressed westward and northward we came all
the time to finer Indians who had more wealth and better
homes than those farther east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“At last we came to a land of plenty. The people lived
in houses and had beans, pumpkins, and calabashes for
food and covered themselves with blankets made of hides.
They were the finest-looking and strongest people we had
seen and intelligent beyond any of the others. They had
nothing they did not give to us. They begged us to pray
for rain and told us that for two years not a drop had fallen.
When we asked where they had got their food, they told us
from the land of the maize. Then I bade them tell me of
this land of the maize, and they told that beyond them was
a land of many people and large houses, where maize grew
all over the land; that the people of that land were wealthy
and wore beautiful plumes and feathers of parrots, and used
precious stones for arrowheads and to decorate their houses.
And they brought to me five beautiful emeralds cut into
arrowheads, and many fine turquoises and beads made of
coral such as come from the South Seas. When I asked
whence they got these stones, they pointed to some lofty
mountains that stand toward the north and told us that
from there came the precious stones, and that near those
mountains were large cities. They said that in those cities
the houses were so large that there were sometimes three or
four lofts one above the other.”</p>

<p>“And did you not go to those cities?” asked Melchior
Diaz, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Cabeza de Vaca. “I did not go because
I heard that toward the sunset were other men of my
kind, and I hurried westward, hoping to meet them. Therefore
I did not go to the land of the cities. I longed once
more to look upon the face of a Spaniard.”</p>

<p>“You have suffered much,” said Melchior Diaz, “but do
not think of it, and now rest.”</p>

<p>Then Melchior Diaz sent off a messenger to Mexico to
carry a letter to the Viceroy de Mendoza, telling him of
Cabeza de Vaca and his strange tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Forthwith the messenger returned with a letter commanding
Cabeza de Vaca and his companions to come at
once to Mexico and appear before the viceroy.</p>

<p>To Mexico they went, and again Cabeza told the strange
story of their wanderings.</p>

<p>“It is a wonderful story,” said the viceroy, when he had
finished, “and you certainly deserve to spend the rest of
your life in ease. Say the word, and I myself will send
you home to Spain.”</p>

<p>Cabeza de Vaca almost wept for joy at these words.
“Gladly will I go, dear friend. Gladly will I go, for I am
weary of wandering and would once more see my own
country.”</p>

<p>So Cabeza de Vaca and two of his companions sailed off
to Spain, and the Viceroy de Mendoza thought much of
the wonderful cities far to the northward.</p>

<h5><i>The Journey of Fray Marcos</i></h5>

<p>The story of Cabeza de Vaca set all New Spain talking
once more of the Seven Cities.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the people, as they talked, “of course
they are the same seven cities Nuño de Guzmán learned of
from Tejos, the Indian. He did not get the right directions,
and so he failed to reach them. But now we know they are
there,” and many were eager to set out at once.</p>

<p>But the Viceroy de Mendoza was a quiet and careful
statesman.</p>

<p>“There have been many lives lost already,” he said, “and
it will be better not to be in too great a hurry. I believe
these are the seven cities sought for by Nuño de Guzmán,
but I shall not send an army until I am sure.”</p>

<p>Then he thought of a monk called Fray Marcos of Niza,
who had been much among the Indians of the north, and he
sent for him to come at once to Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Fray Marcos came, and the Viceroy de Mendoza told
him the story of Cabeza de Vaca.</p>

<p>“Now, Fray Marcos,” said the viceroy, after finishing the
story, “if we should send an army, these Indians would
surely make war upon us and both for them and for us
there would be many lives lost. You understand them, and
it might be that they would let you come among them and
learn what we desire. Perhaps there lies to the northward
as great a nation as Peru or Mexico. It must be taken for
the church and the crown. Will you not be the one to carry
the message of the cross and to take possession of the country
for the king of Spain?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Fray Marcos, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mendoza, smiling. “The negro Stephen
who was with Cabeza de Vaca is here, and he shall be your
guide. Remember that this expedition is to be undertaken
more to spread our knowledge of God than for great wealth.
Therefore, bear in mind that the natives are to be treated
with the utmost kindness, and my displeasure will fall heavy
upon whosoever shall offend them. Say to them that the
Emperor is very angry at those Christians who have been
unkind to them, and that never again shall they be enslaved
or taken from their homes.</p>

<p>“Take special note of their number, and of their manner
of life, and whether they are at peace or at war among
themselves. Notice the nature of the country, the fertility
of the soil, and the character of its products. Learn what
wild animals there are there, and find out if there are any
rivers great or small. Search for precious stones and metals
and, if possible, bring back specimens of them. Also make
careful inquiry if the natives have any knowledge of a neighboring
sea.</p>

<p>“If you shall succeed in reaching the Southern Sea, write
out an account of all your discoveries and bury it at the
foot of the tallest tree and then mark the tree with a cross.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Do the same at the mouth of all rivers, and those who are
sent after you will be on the lookout for such a sign. Take
enough Indians with you so that you can send them back
from time to time to bring to us reports of the route you
have taken and how you are treated by the Indians you meet.
If you shall come to any great city, do not send back word
but come yourself and tell me about it. And lastly, although
all the world belongs to the Emperor, be sure and plant the
cross in those new lands and take possession of them in the
name of the Spanish crown, and never forget that your
life is of great value to your church and your country, and
do not risk it needlessly. Now, go. Make all your plans
and set out as soon as may be.”</p>

<p>Fray Marcos hastened to make his plans, and on the
seventh of March, 1539, he set out from Culiacan with the
negro Stephen and a few faithful Indians.</p>

<p>Several months went by; then, at the end of September,
1539, a traveler in a monk’s gown came walking alone into
Culiacan.</p>

<p>“It is Fray Marcos!” cried the people. “It is Fray
Marcos, who went to search for the Seven Cities!” “Did
you find them, Fray Marcos?” “Where is Stephen, the
negro?” “Are the Seven Cities full of wealth?”</p>

<p>But Fray Marcos would not answer. “I have much to
tell,” he said to them, “but I will tell it only to the Lord de
Mendoza himself.”</p>

<p>To the Lord de Mendoza he told a story even more wonderful
than the story of Tejos, the Indian, or that of Cabeza
de Vaca.</p>

<p>“All the way,” he said, “I found great entertainment, for
after I told the Indians they were not to be enslaved, they
could not do enough to show their love for me. I went
where the Holy Ghost did lead me. The Indians guided
me from place to place, and some went ahead to tell others
that I was coming. Everywhere they came to meet me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
gave me welcome. They had food ready for me; and where
there were no houses, they built bowers of trees and flowers
that I might rest safe from the sun.</p>

<p>“I saw naught that was worthy of notice until there came
to me some Indians from an island off the coast, and these
wore about their necks great shells that were of mother-of-pearl.
To these I showed the pearls which I carried with
me for show, and they told me that in their islands there
were great stores of such, and that there were thirty islands.</p>

<p>“And then I passed through a desert of four days’ journey,
and there went with me the Indians from the island and
from the mountains I had passed. At the end of this
desert I found other Indians, who marveled much to see me,
because they had not before seen a white man. They gave
me great stores of food and sought to touch my garments,
and called me Hayota, which in their language means ‘A
man come from Heaven.’</p>

<p>“As best I could, I told to all these Indians of our Lord
God in Heaven, and of our great Emperor over the sea.
Then I asked them if they knew of any great kingdom
thereabout or of any great cities.</p>

<p>“And they told me that farther on were high mountains,
and at the foot of those mountains was a large and mighty
plain on which were many great towns and people clad in
cotton. Then I showed them metals that I carried with
me and said to them, ‘Have the people of those cities any
of these?’ And they took the gold metal from my hand
and said: ‘Of this do the people of those cities make the
vessels from which they eat, and also do they make of it
thin plates to scrape the sweat from their bodies, and the
walls of their temples are covered therewith.’</p>

<p>“Then I asked concerning the precious stones known to
the people of the cities, and the Indians answered that they
had round, green stones that they prized much and wore
hanging from their noses and ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Indians offered to take me to the cities, but because
it was a long journey from the sea, and your lordship had
commanded me to keep close to the coast, I did not go.</p>

<p>“It was now Passion Sunday, and I felt inclined to tarry
among the people I was with. I did so, but I sent on ahead
of me the negro Stephen.</p>

<p>“I told him to go to the northward fifty or threescore
leagues, and to take with him Indians, of whom he should
send back from time to time messengers bearing me news of
all that he learned.</p>

<p>“We agreed that if it were the mean country of which
he learned, he should send me a cross no longer than my hand;
but if it were a great country, he should send me a cross
the length of two hands; and if it were a country greater
and richer than New Spain, he should send a great cross.</p>

<p>“Stephen went from me on Passion Sunday, after dinner,
and within four days there came to me messengers bearing
a cross as high as a man. He sent me also word that I
should at once come after him, for he had news of a mighty
province; that he had with him certain Indians who had
been to that province, and one of them he sent to me.</p>

<p>“The Indian whom Stephen had sent told me it was
thirty days’ journey beyond the town where Stephen was,
to the first city of the province, which was called Cibola. He
said there were seven great cities in this province all under
one lord. The houses, he said, were made of stone and
the smallest of them were of two lofts, one above the other;
and the house of the lord of the province had four lofts and
was wide and long. He said, too, that the gates of the
finest houses were cunningly wrought with turquoises,
whereof they had plenty.</p>

<p>“The same day that Stephen’s messenger came to me
there came also another Indian from the seacoast, and he
told again of the many islands in the sea and of people who
have many pearls and much gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“And that same day there came to me three Indians with
their faces and breasts and arms painted.</p>

<p>“They came, they said, from a province toward the east
that bordered upon that of the Seven Cities. They had
heard of me and wished to see me. They told me of the
Seven Cities of Cibola, the people, and the houses, in the
same manner that Stephen had sent me word. I sent back
the Indians who had come from the islands on the seacoast,
and hurried on after Stephen.</p>

<p>“Each day messengers came to me from Stephen, all
carrying large crosses and all telling of Cibola.</p>

<p>“At last came Indian messengers who told me of three
other kingdoms called Marata, Acus, and Tonteac. They
said that the people of those provinces dressed even as the
people of Cibola, with gowns of cotton that hang to their
feet, and they bound them with girdles of turquoises. And
they told me much more, to make me know that these provinces
were in all ways as great as Cibola.</p>

<p>“I traveled on for days, stopping to know the people
among whom I passed and always being received by them
with all tenderness.</p>

<p>“They brought me their sick that I might heal them and
sought always to touch my garments. They gave to me
cowhides so well tanned that I could not well believe them
to have been dressed by savage people.</p>

<p>“As I went on, I came to great crosses set up in the
ground by Stephen to let me know that the good news of
the country increased. I came to a pleasant town at last
where indeed were people clad in cotton, both men and
women, and they wore turquoises in their noses and ears.
The lord of the village came with his brethren to greet me,
and they were well dressed in robes of cotton and hides and
wore collars of turquoises about their necks.</p>

<p>“It was a fair country, better than any I had yet seen;
so I set up two great crosses and took possession of it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
His Majesty, the Emperor. They offered me gifts of all
they had, but I took not one thing save food.</p>

<p>“I came now to a desert and went into it, and I found
that the Indians had gone on ahead of me and built bowers
beneath which I ate and slept, and in this manner I traveled
for four days.</p>

<p>“Then I entered a valley where were many people; men
and women came to meet me with food. All of them had
turquoises hanging from their noses and ears and collars of
turquoises three or four times double about their necks.</p>

<p>“Here they knew of Cibola as much as we in New Spain
know of Mexico and could answer all I wished to ask about
the people.</p>

<p>“As I went on I met more and more people, and passed
through a fine country where is much grass and water.
The people were in all ways civil and kind and told me about
Cibola and Acus, and Tonteac and Marata and Quivira.
Here I saw a thousand oxhides all nicely dressed and chains
of turquoise, and they told me they all came from Cibola.</p>

<p>“And now I had two deserts to cross and was fifteen
days’ journey from Cibola.</p>

<p>“I entered the desert, and many Indians went with me,
and others went on ahead to make ready for me; and each
day there came word from Stephen, telling me all was true
and to hurry after him.</p>

<p>“For twelve days I journeyed thus, and then there came
running to meet us an Indian in great fright—his body
covered with sweat and dust and his face showing the greatest
sadness.</p>

<p>“He told us that the day before, Stephen had reached
Cibola, and had sent messengers into the city with presents
for its lord, and to let him know they came in peace.</p>

<p>“But the lord of the city fell into a great rage, and dashed
the presents of Stephen to the ground. In his fury he drove
the messengers out of the city, and told them that if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
again appeared they would surely be killed, as would also
Stephen, if he dared to come near.</p>

<p>“The messengers hurried to Stephen and told him what
had happened, but he was in no wise afraid; he answered
he should go, nevertheless, and bade the Indians fear not,
but to come with him.</p>

<p>“They went on, but as they were about to enter the city,
many of its people met them and seized them and cast them
into a great house that stood just outside. They took from
them all that they had, and left them all night without food
or drink. The next morning Stephen and his Indians tried
to escape, but they were scarce outside their prison when
the people of the city set upon them, and Stephen and all
the Indians, except the messenger and one other, were killed.
These two had been struck down and left for dead, but
were only stunned. They had lain under the dead bodies
of the others until the angry people had gone back into the
city. Then they had crept away.</p>

<p>“My Lord de Mendoza, so great was my grief at this
terrible news that it seemed for a moment I must indeed
die, but when I saw all my Indians begin to weep and lament,
I knew I must not give way.</p>

<p>“I straightway gave to them many of the presents I had
intended for the people of Cibola, and then I resolved that
though I might not enter the city I would still look upon it,
and I told them I would nevertheless go on. They begged
me not to go, but when they saw I was firm two of them
agreed to go with me. So we left the others to await our
return and journeyed forwards. We traveled one day, and
then we came to a round hill. This I climbed, and on looking
down saw at its foot the city of Cibola. It was a fair
city, my lord. The houses were as the Indians told me, of
two and three and four stories and built of stone. The
people were somewhat white and dressed in white garments.
Greatly was I tempted to risk my life and go thither, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
knowing that if I were killed all knowledge of the country
would be lost, I gave it up and contented myself with planting
a cross upon the hilltop in token that I took possession
for the crown of Spain.”</p>

<p>“You have done well, Fray Marcos,” cried Mendoza,
“and now it is time to send an army.”</p>

<h5><i>The Disappointment of Coronado</i></h5>

<p>When Mendoza wanted to send an army, the first person
he thought of was a brave soldier and fine nobleman named
Francisco de Coronado, who sat by his side, listening eagerly.</p>

<p>Coronado knew all about the expedition of Nuño de Guzmán,
and had heard the story of Cabeza de Vaca. Also,
he had talked with Mendoza before the viceroy had sent
Fray Marcos on his journey, and had said he would be willing
to spend a fortune in fitting out an army to take the
Seven Cities.</p>

<p>So Mendoza turned to Coronado and said: “Is it still
your wish, my noble friend, to lead an army against this
kingdom of Cibola?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Coronado.</p>

<p>“Well, then, make ready at once, and I will help you in
every way that I can,” said the viceroy.</p>

<p>The news spread rapidly, and again all New Spain was
talking of the Seven Cities. In a short time three hundred
Spaniards and eight hundred Indians had enlisted, and so
many gentlemen of noble birth had offered to go that the
viceroy was much embarrassed in choosing officers, for of
course he must take the noblest gentlemen, and there were
too many!</p>

<p>A fine sight they were—those cavaliers of Spain—in
their glittering armor, mounted on prancing horses, their
lances gleaming in the sunlight and their banners flying.
Out of Compostela they marched in the gayest spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
thinking of the loads of gold and jewels they would bring
back with them.</p>

<p>But it was very different when they reached the desert
and the mountains. They did not know how to bear the
fatigue of such a journey, nor how to care for their horses
and cattle and sheep. The animals died in large numbers,
and the courage of the soldiers weakened rapidly as they
grew weary.</p>

<p>The soldiers had come with the thought of conquest, so
they did not treat the Indians they met so kindly as Fray
Marcos had done, and of course the Indians did not like
them very well, and in a little while there began to be trouble.</p>

<p>At last they came to a narrow pass in the mountains.</p>

<p>“I am afraid the Indians will try to keep us from passing,”
said Coronado to the Master of the Field. “Go you
with a company of soldiers and guard that pass until all
the army come up. Then we will go through.”</p>

<p>The Master of the Field took his company and stood guard
at the pass. But that night, while all but the sentries were
asleep, the Indians crept down upon them and the sleeping
camp was roused by a shower of stones and arrows and the
wild yells of the Indians.</p>

<p>Now the men had lain down with their guns beside them;
so they were ready, and they sprang up and began fighting
bravely. For a while the battle raged hotly, the Spaniards
firing their guns and the Indians replying with stones and
arrows. But when the Indians saw some of their number
falling dead, they were frightened and fled away in the
darkness, and the Spaniards held the pass.</p>

<p>After that the Spaniards had little peace, but nevertheless
Coronado managed to keep up their courage. On they went,
up through that country we now call Arizona, over almost
the same road that Fray Marcos had traveled. They paused
where is now the city of Tucson, and then marching northeastward,
crossed the Gila River and moved on toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Cibola. At last, where today stands the town of Zuñi,
they reached the first city of the kingdom whose fame had
so long filled with golden dreams the minds of the Spaniards.
But instead of the great, fine, glittering city they had expected
they saw only a village of a few hundred houses.</p>

<p>The hearts of the Spaniards sank as they gazed upon it.
Coronado called three of his men and said to them, “Go
into the city and say to the people that we are not enemies,
but have come in the name of the Emperor, our lord, to
defend them and to join with them in friendship.”</p>

<p>The messengers went into the city and delivered Coronado’s
message, but the people of Cibola received it with scorn.</p>

<p>“We did not ask you to come,” they replied, “and your
lord had no right to send you. This is our land and we can
defend it. Go back to your lord and to your own land, for
if you stay here you shall not one of you live.”</p>

<p>The messengers turned to go back to Coronado, and even as
they went the people of Cibola began firing arrows at them.</p>

<p>Coronado got his men quickly together and gave the
command to attack. The people of Cibola were gathered
upon the walls of their city and rained down arrows and
stones upon the Spaniards as they came. The Spaniards
were many of them so weary from their long journey that
they had not strength enough left to pull a crossbow. Indeed,
for a time it seemed they must be beaten, so fiercely
did the Indians battle against them. The glittering armor
of Coronado and the earnestness with which he cheered on
his men, told the Indians that he was the leader of the
Spaniards, and they tried particularly to kill him. Twice
they felled him to the ground, and once he must surely have
been killed had not a brave knight stood across his body and
guarded him from the rain of stones until he recovered. He
would not give up. Weak from the blows he had received,
aching in every part, and with an arrow sticking in his foot,
he led the last charge, shouting “Santiago!” as he rode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Santiago!” echoed his soldiers as they followed him
straight into the town. The Indians fled as the Spaniards
entered, and the battle was over.</p>

<p>The Spaniards almost wept with rage and despair as they
looked about them. The houses, it is true, were made of
stone and were large, as had been said, but there were no
jeweled gates, no vessels of gold and silver, no fine city, no
stores of wealth to carry back to Spain.</p>

<p>So great was Coronado’s despair that he fell ill almost
unto death. He could not bear to give up. It seemed he
must find those seven wonderful cities. As soon as he was
able he sent out parties in all directions to see what could be
found.</p>

<p>For almost two years they searched. Whenever an Indian
told them a new tale, they started off at once to see if it
were true. They heard of a great river to the westward,
and Arellano, one of the brave officers, led a party at once
in search of it. Across the dry, hot desert of Arizona they
went, and never stopped until they came to the Grand
Cañon of the Colorado. Below them flowed the mighty
river between walls hundreds of feet deep and so steep they
could not descend to the water, though they were almost
dying of thirst as they stood over it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they got back before the army was again
all excitement because an Indian had told a tale of a great
city to the northeastward. Coronado himself led them in
search of it. Up they went through New Mexico, traveling
for days among herds of buffaloes that reached farther than
they could see.</p>

<p>They went so far north as to enter that part of our country
now called Kansas. They found in reward for their
long journey only a few Indian villages.</p>

<p>At last, when more than two thirds of his men were dead,
Coronado gave up and marched back to Mexico. And this
was the last search for the Seven Cities that were not.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_FIFTEEN">CHAPTER FIFTEEN<br />
<span class="smcap">Story-Telling to Intensify Interest in
Geography</span></h3>

<p>In the study of geography the story means as much
as in history. The child is keenly interested in
what he is doing and in what those around him are
doing, and when he discovers that people in China,
in South America, in Australia, or in Russia are doing
the very things he is attempting to do or sees done,
that they are engaged in industrial occupation very
much as his father or uncle or neighbor is engaged in it,
that distant occupation loses its remote quality, and
the country with which it is associated becomes real
and near to him. In the larger sense geography is
something that must be felt and imagined. It is an
interpretation of foreign activities and the regions in
which they take place, and because the story can interpret
these activities, because it can make situations
real and familiar instead of aloof, it is of inestimable
value in teaching the subject. Here the myth and
fairy tale can be used with excellent results, because
through them the child sees something of the struggle
of man in his effort to interpret the world and comes
to have a broader sympathy for the ideals of people
of other regions. Moreover, in many instances it
tends to fix definite information concerning a certain
locality and to invest distant regions with vivid interest,
for to the boy who associates the Rhine or Danube
or Himalayas with the tale of a hero or people who once
lived and did brave deeds there, those rivers and
mountains will be more than black specks on a map.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
If he hears of the two frogs in Japan who started out
to see the world, he will not say that Kioto is somewhere
in South America, because the spot has been fixed in
his mind by a story. Because it is associated with
something he has enjoyed, it stays there, and while
the highest aim of the study of geography is not merely
to stuff the mind with facts, but to broaden the horizon
and bring the world within the child’s own dooryard,
the acquisition of certain information tends to give
him that broad outlook which makes all people seem
creatures of his world and all activities a part of his
own experience. Unfortunately, however, teachers
sometimes lose sight of this fact, and the larger aim is
made subservient to a memorizing of data.</p>

<p>Geography and history are so closely related that
it is difficult to separate them, and in making one vivid
we must draw constantly from the other. The field
is limitless. In fact, there are so many stories to give
the geography class that teachers sometimes say,
“When are we to have time for formal recitations?”</p>

<p>Too much recitation and not enough story is responsible
for the fact that boys and girls sometimes give
startling information about the location of places.
Shorten the recitation period, if necessary, but do
not fail to give the stories that bring far-away places
as near as one’s own dooryard, and let tests and examinations
prove which method is better. We must
possess before we can give, and the pupil who is assigned
a number of pages and expected to recite about them
often fails miserably, because interest, which must
underlie the acquisition of knowledge, has not been
aroused. We may tell him to study the course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Rhine and locate the cities that dot its banks, and one
will mean no more to him than the other. But if he
hears the tale of the building of the king of German
cathedrals and the legend of the architect’s compact
with the Evil One, Cologne will have an individuality
very different from that of Coblenz with its bridge of
boats. If he listens to the tale of Maui fishing up
New Zealand from the bottom of the ocean, of the
demigod chieftain who was the discoverer of Hawaii
and the patriarch of his people, there will pass before
his eyes at the mention of places among the Pacific
Islands pictures of a dark-skinned, sea-loving race
with a history fully as fascinating as that of his own
people.</p>

<p>If there is not time for him to recite it all, let him
write about it. This will help to solve the composition
problem, because the reason for much of the miserable
written English work is due to the fact that the
child has nothing to give. He is told to elaborate
upon a subject that lies far from his interest, one of
which he has little knowledge, with results that every
English teacher knows. But if he has been interested
in it by a story, he can give that story back in oral or
written form, even though the construction be far from
perfect.</p>

<p>Another value of using stories with a geographical
or historical background is that they develop the
child’s social instinct and give him something of a
realization of the brotherhood of man. Through
hearing and reading them he becomes broader and
more tolerant. He sees that in every part of the world
men have their standards and ideals, which, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
they may be greatly at variance with his own, are
entitled to respect because they represent deep convictions
and desires. Instead of viewing the world
through a keyhole, he sees it across unobstructed
fields and comes to have a bigger human understanding.
In the study of geography there is a finer opportunity
than anywhere else in elementary education to divert
the child’s feet from a narrow, provincial trail into
the broad highway of cosmopolitanism.</p>

<p>As in the study of history, so in geography the story
should radiate from local environment to other sections
of the world, and every worker with girls and boys,
whether mother, teacher, or librarian, should endeavor
to give them some idea of the story of their own locality.
The child should know something of the legends
of the people who built their camp fires on the spots
that are his public parks and gardens, and teachers
especially should aid the earnest group of men and
women that is patiently collecting and preserving
our American folklore, by giving some of it to the
children. It will not only heighten pride in their
own locality, but it will broaden their understanding
of other lands and races and their sympathy with the
struggles of different peoples. This kind of work belongs
to the field of history, but it so greatly increases interest
in geography that the teacher should not miss the
opportunity of using this material.</p>

<p>There are legends clustering about every section
of our country that the people of that locality should
know, and it is a matter of regret that the average
man or woman has seldom heard of them. Europeans
are inclined to say we are a people of no traditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
While the charge is untrue, and our land is rich in legendary
lore, it is true that only a small percentage of
Americans are familiar with it. One reason for this
general ignorance is that much of it has been buried
in scientific treatises, which are unavailable to the
layman. But within the last few years a large amount
has been put within reach of the story-teller. The
unceasing work of the American Folklore Society has
resulted in unearthing and preserving much that
would otherwise have been lost and that is important
enough to have a place in our schools. Nothing is
more fascinating to the child than stories of his own
region, and our young people ought to be privileged
to share in that joy with boys and girls of the Old
World.</p>

<p>There are peasant lads in France, Italy, and other
European countries who can entertain by the hour with
tales of their rivers and mountains—not those of some
distant province, but the peaks that tower above their
native village, the streams along which they trudge
on their way to school. California, Washington, and
Oregon children should be given legends of the Yosemite,
of Lake Tahoe, of Mount Shasta, of the Columbia
River, and of Mount Rainier. Boys and girls
among Southern bayous should be taught the traditions
of their region, of the Indians and Creoles who
made history there when that section was a province
of France; while along Northern lake and inland river
are tales of forest folk, of pathfinder and black-robed
message bringer, of knights of the Old World come
to seek fortune in the New, that are a part of the
heritage of every youth living there. Let us give them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to our young people, that they may love their home
spots, not just because they are beautiful and are
theirs, but as the French child loves the Rhone or the
Austrian the Danube, because of the stories that tend
to make them enchanted ground.</p>

<p>In using the story in geography the teacher’s work
does not end with telling the story. The places mentioned
in it should be located on the map, that their
exact position may be fixed in the mind of the child.
Interest in the story will make this a pleasure rather
than a task for the boy, just as it becomes a delight
rather than a hardship for him to follow the route
taken by his father or uncle when he goes on a journey,
or to work out the itinerary of a trip he hopes to take
himself. One small boy studied the geography of Virginia
with keen interest after reading <i>Lord Cornwallis’
Silver Buckles</i>, and more than one man and woman
attest to the fact that some book read and loved during
their school days did more to fix the location of river,
city, and mountain in their minds than hours of classroom
recitation spent in bounding states and countries
and tracing the courses of rivers.</p>

<p>The following legend of Niagara Falls is illustrative
of one type of tale that will greatly add to the child’s
interest in geography by investing certain localities
with story associations. Much other material is given
in the appended bibliography, and the wide-awake
teacher will be able to glean much more from libraries
and adapt it to her work.</p>

<h4>THE GOD OF THE THUNDERING WATER</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from an Iroquois Legend</span></p>

<p>Before the white man sailed westward across the Atlantic,
in fact, before Columbus was born or anybody even dreamed
about a short route to the Indies, a little Indian girl lived
on the shore of Niagara not so very far above the cataract.
She was a happy little thing, and as she grew to maidenhood
she became the fairest girl of her tribe, and her father,
who was a mighty chieftain, promised her in marriage to the
most powerful of his braves. This Indian was a swift
runner, and around the council fire not another tongue was
so nimble or eloquent as his, and never did his arrows fail
to pierce the heart of the deer at which he aimed them.
But that mattered little to the girl. He was not her ideal
of a husband, and she could think of nothing more dreadful
than becoming the mistress of his wigwam. Yet her father
had spoken and she must obey, and with a sad heart she
made ready for the wedding, weaving the handsomest of
wampum belts and ornamenting her moccasins with gay
beads and bits of woodpecker feather.</p>

<p>The wedding morning dawned, and the Indians began the
games and merrymaking that always marked a marriage.
The bridegroom and the young braves vied in races and
wrestling matches, and the women too had a part in the
festivities, singing and chanting weird songs as they tended
the fire and roasted venison for the feast. Everybody was
happy,—every one but the bride, who did not want to
marry, and who sat in her wigwam looking sadly out upon
the sport. Suddenly came the decision that she would not
be the squaw of the man she detested.</p>

<p>Quickly, softly, she crept from the wigwam and hurried
to the river bank. The others were so busy with their merrymaking
that they did not see her go, and soon she came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
where her canoe was moored to some bushes. She stepped
into it, pushed it from shore, and began drifting down the
stream. It was good to be there on the water, for, like all
Indian girls, she loved to paddle, and in her joy of skimming
along with the current she began to sing.</p>

<p>Suddenly a whoop went up from the village of her people.
It was not the cry of those victorious in a game, it was a
shout of anger, a cry of alarm, for they had seen her and
believed she was trying to escape from the marriage every
one knew was distasteful to her. The bridegroom started in
pursuit, then another Indian and another, until every man
in the village was rushing to the river and some had already
begun the chase in canoes.</p>

<p>“They shall not take me back,” the girl murmured.
“I will not go back to the village and become Kunawa’s
squaw.”</p>

<p>With swift, powerful strokes she paddled down the stream.
She forgot that the cataract was roaring below her, forgot
that her canoe was going rapidly and surely toward the
bright foam from which no boat could come back. She
thought only that she was fleeing from a wedding, and not
until she saw the rapids beneath her did she realize her fate.
Then she began her death song, and those in pursuit heard
it for a moment, loud, clear, and plaintive as the canoe cut
into the cataract, then suddenly silenced as it shot down
to the rapids. Some of the women wailed and joined in
the funeral dirge, and some of the others cried out in fear
to the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>“It is the last of Kunawa’s bride!” they exclaimed.
“She is now on her way to the Spirit Land.”</p>

<p>But it was not the last of the girl. Far down in the mist
of the cataract, Heno, the Thunder God, had seen her. He
held forth his arms, and as the canoe dropped to the rapids,
she went into them, and bearing her through the watery
depths, he placed her in a cavern behind the fall where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
had lived since the beginning of things, and where the girl
would live with him henceforth.</p>

<p>Many years passed. She was no longer a young maiden,
but a tall, sturdy woman, and Heno gave her to one of his
sons to be his squaw. She lived there in happiness with him
in the cavern under Niagara, and often she thought of her
people and her native village above beside the river. Because
she remembered and loved them, Heno was kind to
them, and when pestilence came to the region he lifted her
to the shore that she might tell them where to go to escape
the disease.</p>

<p>Once a great monster, a snake all green and white, came
trailing his body through the forest like a river between
hills, and made straight for the village by Niagara to feed
upon the people there. But through the Indian girl Heno
had told them of the coming danger, and they fled before
the monster so fast that when it reached the village it found
only a place of deserted camps. The great creature hissed
with wrath, but Heno saw it from the mists and struck it
dead with a thunderbolt. The great mass rolled to the river,
floated down the stream, and lodged so tight above the
cataract that a fold in its body sent a great volume of
water out of its course, forming the Horseshoe Fall. The
flood centered there destroyed the home of Heno too, but
the Thunder God arose with his children and the Indian
girl, and ascending to the heavens, has lived there ever
since, where he thunders in the cloud mists as he once did
in those of the fall. His voice is so mighty that the echo
of it is always sounding above Niagara, and although white
men say it is nothing but the noise of falling water, the
Indians know better. They know it is the song of the god
of the Thundering Water.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_SIXTEEN">CHAPTER SIXTEEN<br />
<span class="smcap">Story-Telling to Intensify Interest in Nature
Study</span></h3>

<p>Nature study, as a formal subject in the elementary
schools, is often uninteresting to the
child, because many teachers think that there the
bare truth should prevail, and present information
concerning the sciences as a series of dry, emasculated
facts. The result is indifference toward what might
be a keen pleasure, and sometimes even distaste for it.
But if the nature lesson is presented in a manner that
brings vivid pictures to the mind of the child, if he
is given some vision of what cannot be understood
by mere description, it becomes a living reality, and not
only fixes information that is the foundation for scientific
study later, but enlarges the emotional life and
quickens the imagination. It gives him a feeling of
close contact with nature and makes him so responsive
to its varied life, moods, and aspects, that he comes to
love it.</p>

<p>Those who understand nature love it more than those
who do not. The man who knows the elm, the beech,
the hemlock, and various other forest brethren, finds
a pleasure in the woods that is impossible to him to
whom a tree is just a tree. The latter is like Peter
Bell, of whom Wordsworth wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A primrose by a river’s brim</div>
<div class="verse">A yellow primrose was to him,</div>
<div class="verse">And it was nothing more.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He goes on his way thinking that trees are good for
lumber, to produce shade and break the force of winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
that might otherwise blight his crops, but he has little
conception of how they affect human happiness and
human life. When tired and nerve worn, he does not
yearn for the peace of the redwoods, but for some
artificial stimulus in a city distant from the one in
which he has his cares. Why? Because he was not
born with a love of nature that is as rare as genius,
and was not fortunate enough to be led along the path
on which it is acquired. That there are many men
and women of this type is proved by the ruthless way
in which our forests have been destroyed, by the
abuse of privileges in public parks and gardens, by
the way in which trees are slaughtered in city streets.
It is certain that love of nature is not born with every
one, and that what is the fortunate heritage of the
few must be instilled into the many. This can be done,
and it can be done through story-telling. The careless
child, the unobservant child, to whom a flower is just
a flower or a bird a bunch of feathers, can be led to
open his eyes and see what he did not see before,
while the one who has already found joy in the life of
field and stream will respond with intense pleasure
because a new and roseate light is flashed upon what is
already familiar.</p>

<p>Children learn to love nature just as they learn to
love a picture, a dog, or a swimming hole, through
experience with it that gives joyous results. The
country lad, whose Saturdays and vacation days are
associated with cowslips, dragon flies, and quiet hours
beside a trout stream casting a line for the elusive
catch, is not likely to find schoolroom nature study
a dull subject, because, through hours of enjoyment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he is equipped with an emotional and imaginative
background that gives color to every fact presented.
But he who has not had this opportunity, who knows
as little of wild life as a cormorant knows of the Colorado
crags, will not respond eagerly to a series of facts,
because experience has not previously aroused his
imagination concerning them, and he cannot comprehend
their mystery and wonder. If these facts are
presented through the medium of the story, if they
depict the life of the open as vividly as some painting
that meets the eye, they will give pleasure and furnish
incentive for further investigation. They will not
only awaken the uninformed child to a realization of
the wonders and delights nature holds for him, but
they will give the other, more fortunate child additional
pleasure, just as a favorite fairy tale does when told
again and again by one who loves it and can make its
moods his own.</p>

<p>This does not mean that all information should be
presented through the medium of the story. The
story should be used only to give such information as
is natural to the story form. But nature study can be
wonderfully illuminated by the story, because many
of the truths of science do lend themselves to plot,
and where they have been put in parallel literary form,
they are as replete with beauty and imagery as the
fairy tale, and afford the fancy as free play as do the
adventures of sprites and goblins. The marvel of the
brown bulb or seed metamorphosing into the brilliant-hued
blossom, of the homely caterpillar evolving
into a bit of flying color, of the majestic movements
of stars and planets through worlds remote but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
exquisitely constructed as our own, fascinates the child
and furnishes wide, untrammeled avenues along which
his imagination may roam. There is almost no branch
of science that is not rich in material for the story-teller.
Dr. Carrel, the great French specialist, once said that
some day an artist will arise who will weave the facts
concerning the circulation of the blood into a tale as
fascinating as any <i>conte</i> from the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.</p>

<p>It is not likely that physiology will ever be the nucleus
of stories to give to children in the early years of school
life, but Dr. Carrel’s words hold a valuable hint for the
narrator, who should not fail to draw from truth as
freely as he draws from myth and fable. An overdose
of one kind of food, no matter how wholesome, disarranges
the digestive apparatus, and an overdose of
one kind of literature makes a one-sided man. There
are some facts to show that a too free feeding on fairy
tales has led to crooked thinking and susceptibility
to superstition, and the story-teller should balance
his work in improbable tales with those of fact that
fire the imagination because of the marvels related in
them.</p>

<p>This is not so difficult as it may seem, for many
of the truths of science have been put into simple
language by men who were poet enough to bring to
children something of their mystery and beauty, and
there is no dearth of books that can be used with
gratifying results by workers among children as young
as those of six to nine years. Part of the story of
evolution is enjoyed in this period. The boy in the
age of fancy is fascinated by listening to an account
of early man’s struggle with nature, and tales of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
tree dwellers, of cave and cliff dwellers, of the discovery
of fire and the adventures of the first wanderers, mean
as much to him as any fairy tale, because they have
the very characteristic that makes the fairy tale delightful—an
element of mystery that permits the fancy
to roam unchecked.</p>

<p>Older children revel in the truths of science, if they
are presented in story form. Take, for instance, David
Starr Jordan’s “Story of a Stone.” Where is there a
fairy tale more fascinating than this narrative of “a
bit of petrified honeycomb,” plowed up by a Wisconsin
husbandman as he made ready to sow his winter wheat?
The style and language have the charm of Andersen,
the plot is as well sustained as that of any Thuringian
folk tale collected by Grimm, and it begins as fairy
tales have begun since the beginning of time:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Once upon a time, a great many years ago, so many,
many years that one grows very tired in trying to think
how long ago it was; in those old days when the great Northwest
consisted of a few ragged and treeless hills, full of
copper and quartz and bordered by a dreary waste of sand
flats, over which the Gulf of Mexico rolled its warm and
turbid waters as far north as Escanaba and Eau Claire; in
the days when Marquette harbor opened out toward Baffin’s
Bay, and the northern ocean washed the crest of Mount
Washington and wrote its name on the pictured rocks;
when the tide of the Pacific, hemmed in by no snow-capped
Sierras, came rushing through the Golden Gate between the
Ozarks and the northern peninsula of Michigan, swept over
Plymouth Rock, and surged up against Bunker Hill; in the
days when it would have been fun to study geography,
because there were no capitals, nor any products, and all
the towns were seaports,—in fact, an immensely long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
time ago, there lived somewhere in the northeastern part of
Wisconsin a little jellyfish.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Jordan has also woven into story form information
concerning the animal life of sea and stream, of
a mother and baby seal, in the delightful tale of “Matka
and Kotik,” and there is not a boy or a girl in the heroic
period who does not listen eagerly to the adventures of
a salmon, “a curious little fellow, not half an inch long,
with great, staring eyes which made almost half his
length, and with a body so transparent that he could
not cast a shadow.” The account of the battle of the
fish there under the ripples of the Cowlitz, the beginning
of the eventful journey down the river, the merry
conflict with the herring and the terrible one with the
sea lions, swimming always and always, growing larger
and more daring, and having in his watery realm as
many adventures as bold Robin had in his greenwood,
hold the children from the beginning to the end of the
story. They sympathize as he struggles up the stream
again, “growing poor and ragged and tired,” and
through his life and adventures they come to have an
interest in the world of fishes that they will not have
without the tale. Such stories demonstrate the fact
that information concerning the sciences can be put
into fascinating story form, and every worker with
young folk should endeavor to present some of it
through this delightful medium.</p>

<p>The child will find such tales far more appealing than
the so-called nature stories in which animals are over-personified
and in which they meet man in situations
that every intelligent boy or girl knows are impossible.
A lad is not brought into harmony with nature by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
given yarns that caricature nature, and many of the
modern nature stories do this very thing. Children
know that a wild bear does not walk into a little girl’s
flower garden, and then politely say “I am sorry”
and back out because the small mistress of the garden
is kind and instead of throwing stones at him explains
in elegant English that it is rude to go into another’s
property unbidden. They know that animals and
children do not converse together in the same language,
and that bears do not have courses in ethics. The
nature story that fascinates the child must be true to
nature’s laws. He may listen to some of the sugary,
impossible yarns written to point a moral, but they do
not give him keen pleasure, and because they are
ridiculous in his eyes, he draws no lesson from them.
One of the aims of story-telling is to give ethical instruction,
but there is a wealth of tales that reflect
nature and life correctly that should be used for this
purpose, and the facts of science should not be distorted
in an attempt to emphasize a lesson.</p>

<p>Tales pervaded by over-sentimentalism will not
stir deep response in children. This is why the nature
story that is true to the facts of science is the one that
interests the boy or girl. It is like the racial tale,
full of conflict, of temporary defeat and final triumph.
The young salmon grown old, struggling up Snake
River to the foot of the Bitter Root Mountains, was
sore of muscle and unsightly of skin, and his tail was
frayed and torn, but the desire of his nature was fulfilled
at last. He scooped out a nest and covered
the eggs of his companion, and then, because the work
of his life was done, was free to drift downstream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Such stories give insight into nature and engender
a love of nature; and besides quickening the imagination
and enriching the emotional life, they help to give
stability to the child character, because through them
he learns the workings of certain inexorable laws.</p>

<p>There is such a vast amount of material to use in
teaching nature study, that the suggestions and bibliography
given in this chapter can by no means be
comprehensive. In the realm of geology there is the
story of limestone, of slate, of quartz and granite, of
rock salt and sandstone, and particularly interesting
to the child is the story of coal. For him it abounds
in color, and beautiful indeed are the pictures that
he sees as he listens to this narrative of the carboniferous
forests that grew in the beginning of time, of
the lush, dank swamps of the Permian or Triassic or
Miocene Period, and the strange animal life that peopled
them. From astronomy and botany one may glean
as much as from geology, while entomology, zoölogy,
and ichthyology hold untold delights for the child.</p>

<p>A wonderful science story is that of the coral polyp,
building from some submerged cliff or crag until a little
island rises above the blue water. In my own childhood
it meant as much as ever a fairy tale meant, and
I can still feel the pleasure I experienced the first time I
heard it. It is full of mystery and wonder, and a story
of rare beauty for the child. I have used it often in
story-telling, and it never fails to bring enthusiastic
response; and very popular with the children is this
song of the insect builders, of which I do not know
the authorship, but which is one of the fragrant memories
of my childhood:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Far down in the depths of the deep blue sea,</div>
<div class="verse">An insect train works ceaselessly;</div>
<div class="verse">Moment by moment and day by day,</div>
<div class="verse">Never stopping to rest or play,</div>
<div class="verse">Rock upon rock they are rearing high,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the top looks out on the sunny sky:</div>
<div class="verse">The gentle winds and the balmy air</div>
<div class="verse">Little by little bring verdure there,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the summer sunbeams gayly smile</div>
<div class="verse">On the birds and flowers of the little isle.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Older children enjoy hearing about the different
forms of coral, of the characteristics of that of the
Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, and of the
Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic. They enjoy, too,
hearing about the coral industry, of the fishing for it
along the shores of Africa, of the departure of the
seekers from Sicily, of the Feast of the Coral Fishers
that is such a picturesque feature of the island life, of
the polishing and carving and preparing the product
for trade; they like the legend the southern Italians
tell of how the first medallion in Sicily was made as
an offering of gratitude by a fisher lad to the young
Princess of Naples. From beginning to end the coral
story is a narrative that charms the child, and it is
but one of the forms of sea life, which holds rich opportunities
for the narrator, while sea life is but one of
the fields of science from which he can glean with splendid
results. In fact, the possibilities for story work
in the teaching of science are almost beyond imagining
until one begins to survey the field and enumerate
sources of material, and the story-teller will be restricted
in it only by her ability to organize material
and present it to the children in story form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes writers, thinking they will make nature
stories more enjoyable to boys and girls, people them
with supernatural folk who are supposed to be responsible
for the marvels that occur in them. It is
a practice that scientists decry, and it is condemned by
all who believe that a story fit to give to children
must be worthy of the name of literature, and consequently,
whether fact or fiction, must be true in
spirit. The tale that portrays a fairy up in the sky
keeping the planets in motion like so many checkers
on a board, or one in which enchanted creatures bury
their beads in the ground, causing them to send up
roses and lilies and other beautiful blossoms, is not a
nature story. It may be a charming fanciful tale,
but it should not be given to teach the truths of
science. Science stories, like Bible stories, need no
sugar coating to make them attractive. When given
as stories, and not as a string of facts, they are full of
suspense, and accounts of actual happenings in star
land, under the waves, or deep in the earth are as
fascinating to the child as the fancied ones of nature’s
forces were to primitive man in the forest, when he
crept close to the tribal story-teller and in big-eyed,
wondering awe sought to know the meaning of the great
globule that gleamed in the sky by day and the numberless
tiny ones that gleamed there by night. The primitive
animal tale, which gives early man’s belief as to
how certain creatures came by their characteristics,
is very interesting to the child, and while in a broader
sense it belongs to the field of geography, my own
experience has been that if told in connection with
animals or flowers studied, it is received with enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
by boys and girls. But the child should understand
that these narratives are primitive man’s conception,
and that the science stories are the real “why”
and “how” stories.</p>

<h4>THE WONDERFUL BUILDERS</h4>

<p>Out in the heart of the Pacific, far out where the blue
waves roll their shining masses between Samoa and the Australian
mainland, where the brown-skinned islanders and the
white-winged sea birds seem always happy, a little animal
floated around one day, floated from among the shoals of
Tutuila toward the open sea. It was a tiny creature, and
as curious as it was tiny, for it looked more like a spot of
clear jelly than anything else, and its name was Polyp.</p>

<p>Quite lazily it floated about in the water, now under a
stretch of seaweed, all purple and opalescent like ropes of
wonderful colors, now through the clear, bright current
past the gaping mouth of a shark. But the shark, although
always on the watch for something to devour, did not get
the little polyp, and soon it came to a submerged rock deep
under the waves. This seemed a very good resting place,
and there the polyp stayed.</p>

<p>Days passed, weeks lengthened into months, and still
the polyp kept to its place on the under-sea rock. But it
was not drowsing and sleeping like a lazy creature. It was
busily at work, for the very minute it landed on the rock
it decided to make a house.</p>

<p>Now you must not think that it could not work, because,
although it did look like a drop of jelly and was small and
curious, it was alive. It had arms, very, very tiny arms,
finer than the finest silk thread in your mother’s workbasket,
and so thin and delicate looking that nobody could see them.
But those arms were stronger than they looked, and with
them it held on to the rock tight and fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, what a queer house-making! The little, jellylike
body began to swell. It raised itself up in the shape of a
tube, and around the edge of the tube came a little rim.
This rim was the beginning of the house of the polyp.</p>

<p>The waves rolled on. The sun beat down brightly and
hotly as it always beats down in the South Sea country,
and then came another change. A knot rose in the middle
of the jelly, and out of that knot reached a mouth and feelers.</p>

<p>Now the work began in earnest. The polyp began to eat,
to eat as greedily as a boy who has had not a bit for a whole
day. It took in chalk and phosphorus from the sea food
that came its way, yet it seemed never to get enough, and
all the while the little feelers kept reaching out for more
food and pouring it into the open mouth. As it ate, the
chalk it took in piled around the little rim, which I told you
was the beginning of the house, and although the polyp
wanted much to hold some of that nice chalk food in its mouth
long enough to get the full taste, it could not. The white
substance went right down and piled up on the rim; so it
is no wonder that the little creature was always hungry.</p>

<p>Well, it ate and it ate. The rim kept growing and growing,
as of course it must with so much chalk piling up on it,
and as the house grew higher and higher the polyp kept
moving to the top. The part below was hard and white
like stone, and still the polyp kept eating, eating, and building,
building.</p>

<p>For a long time it kept on, until finally it died. Then
one day another drop of living jelly floated that way, and
finding the chalk house of the other polyp, stopped there and
began building on top of it. The waves rolled on. The
sun shone, and all the while the house went steadily higher.
Other polyps too came and began building beside and above
it, and as they died they left their hard, white homes behind
them as the first polyp had done. Others and still others
came, until, as many, many years passed, the chalk houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
reached the top of the water and men called them an
island.</p>

<p>The waves rolled by. Seaweed drifted that way and
lodged itself on the chalk reefs. It decayed and turned to
soil. Sometimes the water and sometimes the wind brought
bits of plant and seed from some other older islands, until
at last there were flowers and trees and birds singing in the
branches.</p>

<p>Now the ships of the world sail by, going toward China
or Australia or to the American shores far, far away,
and sometimes they stop at the little island, and sometimes
those on board rest there among the palms and think it so
delightful a land that they wish they never had to go away,
but might stay there always and always. Yet but for a
wee, curious sea creature that island would not be, for it
had its beginning in a tiny animal, more like a drop of
jelly than anything else, that floated one day between Samoa
and the Australian mainland, and made its house upon a
bit of submerged rock.</p>

<span class="smcap">Story-Telling in Domestic Science and Manual
Training</span></h3>

<p>People are likely to smile when a story-telling
enthusiast suggests that his art will intensify the
interest in manual training and domestic science, but
a little investigation usually convinces them that this
contention is not merely a wild theory. Cooking and
sewing and wood, metal, and leather working each has
an interesting story, and through understanding how
these crafts originated and how they have developed
with the progress of the race, he comes to have an
appreciation of their true dignity and value. In a
broad sense these tales belong to the field of history
and geography, for domestic science and manual training
have a background in history and present-day
geography. But since the school gives them as separate
subjects, a consideration of story materials touching
them will be valuable to teachers of these subjects.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from the first roast meat of primitive
man, discovered by accident to be more delectable
than that untouched by heat, to the banquet of the
twentieth-century gourmet, but they are chapters of
the same tale, each intervening portion of which is
interesting. There seems to be no relation between the
grass skirt of the prehistoric belle and the creations of
Worth or Paquin, but they are links in the same chain,
beads strung upon the same thread, as are the rush
mats of the cave woman and the rugs of Teheran.
There are dozens of stories to give to girls that will
increase their interest and delight in household crafts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Tales of the lace makers of Italy and Spain, of medieval
tapestry weavers, of dower chests of European peasant
maids, the contents of which pass from generation to
generation, of royal costumers and court tailors, their
problems, patience, and artistry, all tend to give a
touch of romance to something many girls are inclined
to hold in contempt. They enjoy hearing about cookery
in foreign lands, of ways of serving meals that are
very different from our own, and no one is more amused
by Lamb’s “Dissertation on Roast Pig” than she who
deals with problems of roasting and baking.</p>

<p>Domestic-science girls who are told something of the
legends clustering around various foodstuffs enjoy the
cooking class more than those who hear nothing but
lectures on chemistry, dietetics, and comparative nutritive
values, and they take more pleasure in preparing
a meal because they know stories about the various
dishes that comprise that meal.</p>

<p>This is no unproved theory, but one that has been
tried successfully with a group of fourteen-year-old
girls, who took keener delight in bread making after
being told of the bakers of Nuremberg and who brewed
coffee with more interest when they knew the tale of
how Arabians discovered the use of coffee.</p>

<p>There are stories of wood, metal, and leather workers
that should be given to every boy, not only because
they throw new light upon what he is doing and add
interest to it, but because they lead him to respect
those who toil with their hands. Stories of medieval
carving, of house building in different lands and ages,
now of the brush hut of the Australian aborigine, now
of the workmanship in the palace of a sultan or czar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of the poet craftsmen of Nuremberg, of the pottery
making of the Aztecs, of the building of Venice upon
piles hewn from Tyrolean forests, these and dozens of
kindred subjects are rich in materials that will give
children pleasure and knowledge. To the boy or girl
who loves the work in manual training and domestic
science they bring additional pleasure, while in the indifferent
they awaken interest; and, moreover, the
snobbish child who is inclined to think handcraft beneath
his respect, will be led to see that the carpenter
who strives to make each effort more worthy than the
preceding one, or the housewife who puts the best of
herself into the preparation of a meal, is in the same
class with Phidias or Shakespeare in earnestness of
purpose, even though not in results, and is as deserving
of honor. The first step toward success with these
branches is to dignify them in the eyes of children, and
nothing accomplishes this as effectually and rapidly as
the story. To know that the crafts were worthy of
the best efforts of those of other times and lands is to
make them feel they are worthy also of their best
effort.</p>

<p>There is another reason why these stories should be
told. In the midst of the agitation in favor of vocational
training, the force of which is sweeping away and
modifying some of the old educational standards, there
is danger that in catering to the demand for the practical
in schools we neglect that which conduces to
dreams and ideals.</p>

<p>A man may advance beyond the ranks of a journeyman
joiner and make a good living if he has no thought
beyond the work of each day as it dawns, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
vision he cannot become the master builder, and
romance is the corner stone upon which the temple of
vision stands. The palaces of old Hellas were built to
strains of music, for the beauty-loving Greeks knew
that melody gave men lofty thoughts, and believed
work performed to its accompaniment would be of
higher order than that performed without it. Bands
were hired to play as the toilers worked, and boys who
were to become builders were inspired to emulate the
efforts of great craftsmen by being told stories of their
achievement. In our day we cannot expect the state
to provide bands and symphony orchestras to inspire
toilers, but during the days of their apprenticeship we
can give them tales that will have a tendency to glorify
their chosen craft. We can cause them to feel that
only the best efforts of hand and brain are fit to go into
this craft, because it is a monument to the memory of
those who lived and died in its ranks, and that every
worthy effort of each succeeding toiler helps to make
that monument nobler and more enduring.</p>

<h4>THE DERVISH OF MOCHA</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from an Arabian Folk Tale</span></p>

<p>The dervish Hadji Omar was a fortunate man. No one
of his day was so well versed in lore of the ancients and in
the knowledge of his own time, no one was so highly esteemed
by his people or so loved and trusted by the caliph. At
every royal banquet he sat in a seat of honor, and whenever
he went through the streets of Mocha the populace shouted,
“Hail, Omar!”</p>

<p>But there came a time when the fortunes of the dervish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
changed. One afternoon as he sat in the court garden he
heard a conversation that dismayed him. Beyond the palm
trees that screened him from their sight, the caliph and his
council were planning how to defraud the common people
and enrich themselves. Hadji Omar listened, grieved, and
that night went to his friend, told what he had heard, and
tried to dissuade him from a course of dishonor.</p>

<p>Then the caliph forgot all the happy hours he had spent
with the dervish, forgot that he had loved him even as a
brother, and remembered only that the dervish was trying
to interfere in his plan. He flew into a rage and declared
that Omar should be exiled from Mocha, and that a price
would be upon his head should he ever return. Never again
should he sit at the royal banquet table. Never again should
he pass through the streets amid cries and calls of endearment.
He should live in the wilds like a hunted creature
and get his food as the birds of the field get theirs.</p>

<p>So out from the city that he loved went the wise and
righteous dervish. He took the camel trail into the desert,
and after a time came to an oasis where he stayed. A
miserable existence he had there, because few food plants
grew in the spot. Sometimes a caravan came by, and a
merchant or camel driver pitied him and gave him dates or
milk. But sometimes he had nothing to eat, and always
his meals were so scanty that he grew thin and weak and
haggard.</p>

<p>One day—he had been a long time without food and was
faint from hunger—he found some berries growing on a
tree beside a spring. They were so bitter that he could
not eat them; so he tried the experiment of roasting them
over the coals. This made them more palatable, but still
they were viciously hard. Hadji Omar was so hungry that
he was willing to do any amount of work to get food; so he
boiled the berries, hoping they would soften. Still they
were hard, but he managed to eat a few of them and drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of the water. His hunger and fatigue seemed gone, and he
realized he had made a great discovery.</p>

<p>Hastening back to the city, he told the guard his story
and was allowed to go into the presence of the caliph. There
he produced some of the roasted berries, which were boiled
according to his direction, and the governor and council
drank of the water. They pronounced it a kingly beverage,
and the decree went forth that Hadji Omar was to go free.</p>

<p>Thereafter he lived with the caliph, who loved and trusted
him as before and led a more exemplary life because of the
influence of the goodly dervish.</p>

<p>Hadji Omar was honored during his remaining years, and
after his death was revered as a saint, not only because he
was wise and righteous, but because he discovered to Arabia
the beverage of the coffee berry.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_EIGHTEEN">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN<br />
<span class="smcap">Does the Work of the Story-Teller Pay?</span></h3>

<p>And now arises the question, Does all this effort on
the part of the story-teller pay? Is it worth the
labor required for the domestic-science supervisor, the
manual-arts director, the music, literature, geography,
or history teacher, to prepare stories that touch upon
his work? That question can best be answered by
estimating results.</p>

<p>As stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_ONE">the opening chapter of Part One</a>, story-telling
can simplify the entire education problem. It
will create noble ideas in boys and girls of today just
as it created ideals and established standards in those
of the past. It will arouse an ambition to live and to
achieve so that they may be worthy of the emulation
of children of the future even as they emulate the
heroes of days gone by. In no other way can such
deep desire be awakened as through story hearing and
reading. In no other way do children realize so completely
the truth of Longfellow’s words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Lives of great men all remind us</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We can make our lives sublime,</div>
<div class="verse">And, departing, leave behind us</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Footprints on the sands of time.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet in many homes story-telling is almost unknown
because the mother does not deem it of sufficient value
to make some sacrifice of her time and provide for it.
She does not know that the story-telling mothers of
the past have been those whose children have risen
up and called them blessed; that the confidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
their boys and girls, won around the fireside as old-time
tales were told, has been held unshaken to the
end.</p>

<p>The force that in the long ago moved men to great
achievement has lost none of its power. Twentieth-century
children respond to stories as eagerly as did
boys and girls by the sea of Hellas when Greece was
young, as they did in medieval castle hall to the
strains of minnesinger and harper, because child
nature does not change. The story hour in the home
is a formidable rival of the street and the nickelodeon,
and the teacher whose fund of tales is large and who
tells them joyously has little trouble with discipline.
Her charges know that she holds the key to Magic
Land, and that if they are good she will open the gate.
They remember her with affection, and best of all
remember the dreams that came into being under her
spell. She is queen of her little realm through the
royal right of the minstrel, and no pretender can dislodge
her from her throne in the hearts that she has
won.</p>

<p>Yet some school officials, men of education and
refinement, regard story-telling as a very good means
of entertainment, but unworthy of a place in the curriculum,
and when urged to include it ask, “Does it
pay?”</p>

<p>If it is worth anything to make formal schoolroom
subjects joyous instead of boresome, then story-telling
pays; if it is necessary to give the child something
that will be a perennial rainbow in his soul, something
that will keep him sweet and full of faith and
hope when disappointments come and illusions go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that will cause him to laugh at age even in the time of
white hairs and wrinkles, then story-telling is vitally
necessary. He cannot grow bitter who possesses
Aladdin’s lamp. Dark skies may lower over his head
and the thunder crash ominously about him, but if
the seeds of romance have been planted in his soul, if
poesy has been nurtured into flower there by the world’s
best stories heard in his youth, he will retain, even in
the midst of blackness and tempest, a vision of turquoise
skies behind the clouds, a dream of sun-kissed
fields where grow everlasting flowers of fragrance and
beauty.</p>

<p>Is the reward to the worker not worth the price?
One guerdon lies in the thought that he who joins the
ranks of story-tellers becomes a member of a glorious
company, one with which the greatest souls of the
world were not unwilling to be identified. Goethe
never felt it beneath his dignity to gather a group of
children about him and delight them with a tale, and
nothing speaks more eloquently of the sweetness of
Verdi’s nature than one of his letters to his librettist
that relates how, in his visits back to the hill town
where he was born, it gladdened him to see gamins
swarm from every quarter, exclaiming, “Una favola,
signor, una favola!”</p>

<p>“He is a happy man,” says Châteaubriand, “who
keeps through a turbulent lifetime the heart of a child,
who carries with him to the end of his journey some of
the illusions stored up in his youth, for contact with
envy and calumny and deception are apt to cause them
to take flight.” The author of <i>Faust</i> and the creator
of <i>Otello</i> each had his share of brushing against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
things that make men bitter. They had sounded the
depths of discouragement and disappointment, yet
they had the hearts of children, and who knows but
that telling stories to children had something to do
with keeping them young? During Verdi’s period of
struggle and heartbreak, when Milan jeered at his
compositions and critics declared him a man of no
talent, when obstacles piled so high it seemed beyond
mortal power to remove them, when no one in the city
but himself and his wife believed in him, instead of
becoming sour and worthless, as any but a granitic
nature like his would have done, he returned to his
native highlands and told stories to children who
thought him more wonderful than a king; then he went
back to his labor strong and fit. Forgetting himself in
delighting the village <i>bambinos</i> bolstered up his courage
and his faith and helped to make him an exuberant
giver. Perhaps the present-day story-teller, like that
master at Roncone, if he approach his work reverently
and keep in mind a thought of what it has meant to
the world, may receive as much as he gives.</p>

<h3 id="STORIES_FOR_TELLING">STORIES FOR TELLING</h3>

<h4>THE STORY OF THE MAN IN THE MOON</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Alsatian Folk Tale—Christmas Story—Ethics, teaching
honesty</i>)</p>

<p>The man in the moon was once a merry peasant, who
ever so long ago lived quite amicably with his good wife
and children, and had a hut with a wooden floor and a roof
whose thatch was as thick as any in the village. Always
there was plenty of black bread and goat’s milk, and sometimes
on Sundays or holidays the family felt rich enough to
afford a bit of pork. But one Holy Night that peasant
turned dishonest, and then something happened.</p>

<p>“What shall we have for the Christmas feast?” asked
his wife, who was fat and jolly. “Shall it be our good rye
bread and a fine joint of meat?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” the merry husband answered, “but that is
not enough. There shall be cabbage too.”</p>

<p>At his words the wife opened her mouth so wide that it
looked like a big round window in her face.</p>

<p>“Cabbage!” she gasped. “Pray, how can that be,
since we have not a leaf in the hut?”</p>

<p>The peasant nodded in a knowing way and answered,
“To be sure, there is none there now, but there will be by
and by.”</p>

<p>Then he held his tongue as if he thought it unwise to talk
too freely to a woman, took a basket, and went out of the
door. His wife was much excited. She was sure he had
some secret message from the fairies, for it was in that far-away
time when strange and marvelous things happened.</p>

<p>Down along the road the peasant hurried, smiling like a
village maiden on the way to meet her sweetheart at the fair.
Everywhere lights gleamed from the windows, and he laughed
at the sight of them, for he knew people were inside, thinking
of the feast and the Holy Night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which makes it safe for me,” he murmured. On and
on he went, never stopping until he came to a cabbage
patch, the largest and finest in the village. They were
bigger than his head, those cabbages, and every one of
them belonged to the mayor.</p>

<p>“But some shall go into my good wife’s pot,” he laughed
as he saw them, and climbing the fence he went into the
patch and began to help himself.</p>

<p>Then suddenly along the road came a child on a snow-white
horse. He rode as if nothing could halt him, but
seeing the man in the patch, he stopped and shouted, “What
are you doing?” The peasant looked to right and left and
began to stammer, “Just b-b-b-borrowing some of the
m-m-m-mayor’s cabbages,” he replied, as he threw a plump
one into his basket.</p>

<p>The clear, strong tones rang out again, “You steal, and
on the Holy Night too! So you and your basket shall go
to the moon.”</p>

<p>Then, whisk! Up the peasant started and never stopped
until he came to the middle of the moon, and there he has
stayed ever since. Whether or not he ate the cabbages, no
one knows, but he and his basket are there to this day,
and every night when the moon is full you may see them.</p>

<h4>THE DISCONTENTED PIG</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Thuringian Folk Tale—Ethics, teaching contentment</i>)</p>

<p>Ever so long ago, in the time when there were fairies, and
men and animals talked together, there was a curly-tailed
pig. He lived by himself in a house at the edge of the
village, and every day he worked in his garden. Whether
the sun shone or the rain fell he hoed and dug and weeded,
turning the earth around his tomato vines and loosening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the soil of the carrot plot, until word of his fine vegetables
traveled through seven counties, and each year he won the
royal prize at the fair.</p>

<p>But after a time that little pig grew tired of the endless toil.</p>

<p>“What matters it if I do have the finest vegetables in
the kingdom,” he thought, “since I must work myself to
death getting them to grow? I mean to go out and see the
world and find an easier way of making a living.”</p>

<p>So he locked the door of his house and shut the gate of
his garden and started down the road.</p>

<p>A good three miles he traveled, till he came to a cottage
almost hidden in a grove of trees. Lovely music sounded
around him and Little Pig smiled, for he had an ear for
sweet sounds.</p>

<p>“I will go look for it,” he said, following in the direction
from which it seemed to come.</p>

<p>Now it happened that in that house dwelt Thomas, a cat,
who made his living playing on the violin. Little Pig saw
him standing in the door pushing the bow up and down
across the strings. It put a thought into his head. Surely
this must be easier and far more pleasant than digging in a
garden!</p>

<p>“Will you teach me to play the violin, friend cat?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Thomas looked up from his bow and nodded his head.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” he answered; “just do as I am doing.”</p>

<p>And he gave him the bow and fiddle.</p>

<p>Little Pig took them and began to saw, but squeak!
quang! No sweet music fell upon his ear. The sounds he
heard were like the squealing of his baby brother pigs when
a wolf came near them.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he cried; “this isn’t music!”</p>

<p>Thomas, the cat, nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” he said. “You haven’t tried long enough.
He who would play the violin must work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I think I’ll look for something else,” Piggywig
answered, “because this is quite as hard as weeding my
garden.”</p>

<p>And he gave back the bow and fiddle and started down
the road.</p>

<p>He walked on and on, until he came to a hut where lived
a dog who made cheese. He was kneading and molding
the curd into cakes, and Little Pig thought it looked quite
easy.</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to go into the cheese business myself,”
he said to himself. So he asked the dog if he would teach
him.</p>

<p>This the dog was quite willing to do, and a moment later
Little Pig was working beside him.</p>

<p>Soon he grew hot and tired and stopped to rest and fan
himself.</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed the dog, “you will spoil the cheese.
There can be no rest time until the work is done.”</p>

<p>Little Pig opened his eyes in amazement.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” he replied. “Then this is just as hard as
growing vegetables or learning to play a violin. I mean to
look for something easier.”</p>

<p>And he started down the road.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river, in a sweet green field, a
man was taking honey out of beehives. Little Pig saw him
as he crossed the bridge and thought that of all the trades
he had seen, this suited him best. It must be lovely there
in the meadow among the flowers. Honey was not heavy
to lift, and once in a while he could have a mouthful of it.
He ran as fast as he could go to ask the man if he would
take him into his employ.</p>

<p>This plan pleased the bee man as much as it pleased the
pig.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking for a helper for a year and a day,”
he said. “Begin work at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave Little Pig a veil and a pair of gloves, telling him
to fasten them on well. Then he told him to lift a honeycomb
out of a hive.</p>

<p>Little Pig ran to do it, twisting his curly tail in the joy
of having at last found a business that suited him. But
buzz, buzz! The bees crept under his veil and inside his
gloves. They stung him on his fingers, his mouth, his ears,
and the end of his nose, and he squealed and dropped the
honey and ran.</p>

<p>“Come back, come back!” the man called.</p>

<p>“No, no!” Little Pig answered with a big squeal. “No,
no, the bees hurt me!”</p>

<p>The man nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Of course they do,” he said. “They hurt me too!
That is part of the work. You cannot be a beekeeper without
getting stung.”</p>

<p>Little Pig blinked his beady eyes and began to think hard.</p>

<p>“It seems that every kind of work has something unpleasant
about it. To play the violin you must practice
until your arm aches. When you make cheese you dare
not stop a minute until the work is done, and in taking
honey from a hive the bees sting you until your head is on
fire. Work in my garden is not so bad after all, and I am
going back to it.”</p>

<p>So he said good-by to the bee man and was soon back in
his carrot patch. He hoed and raked and weeded, singing
as he worked, and there was no more contented pig in all
that kingdom. Every autumn he took his vegetables to
the fair and brought home the royal prize, and sometimes,
on holidays, the cat and the dog and the bee man came to
call.</p>

<h4>THE BAT AND HIS PARTNERS</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Old Bavarian Folk Tale—Helpful in Nature Study</i>)</p>

<p>Once upon a time a strange thing happened. A cormorant,
a bat, and a bramble met at the mouth of the river Elbe
one day and told a sorrowful story. Each was almost bankrupt;
so they decided to postpone paying their debts, put
their remaining possessions together, and share in the consequent
weal or woe.</p>

<p>They bought a merchant vessel, a ship large and strong,
and so seaworthy it seemed it could sail to the nethermost
parts of the Spanish Main. Wool was precious then as
now, and in a country far away a hundredweight of sheep’s
fleece brought many a gold doubloon. So they freighted
the vessel with the best wool that was to be had and joyfully
watched the white sails disappear in the pearl-gray
mist. But a storm arose and angry winds dashed their
galleon against demon-like rocks. Instead of reaching a
distant land of gold doubloons the ship went to Davy
Jones’s locker, and her precious cargo made couches for the
mermaids.</p>

<p>Then sad indeed was the plight of these partners on the
North Sea shore! Bailiffs began to sue them for payment
of their debts, and ever since that time the bat has flown
by night, for in no other way can he avoid his creditors.
The cormorant, a solitary black figure, still broods beside
the waves and dives into the sea, hoping to retrieve his
shattered fortune, while the bramble has turned thief.
Whenever a sheep goes by, he seizes a bit of the fleece, trying
in this way to make up for the loss of the wool that went
to the bottom of the Spanish Main instead of bringing him
the gold of which he had dreamed.</p>

<h4>BRIER ROSE</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from Grimm</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Wonder Tale</i>)</p>

<p>In olden times there lived a king and queen, who lamented
day by day that they had no children; and yet never a one
was born. One day, as the queen was bathing and thinking
of her wishes, a frog skipped out of the water and said to
her: “Your wish shall be fulfilled. Before a year passes
you shall have a daughter.”</p>

<p>As the frog had said, so it happened, and a little girl was
born who was so beautiful that the king almost lost his
senses; but he ordered a great feast to be held, and invited
to it not only his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, but
also all the wise women who were kind and affectionate to
children. There happened to be thirteen in his dominions,
but since he had only twelve golden plates out of which
they could eat, one had to stay at home. The feast was
celebrated with all the magnificence possible, and, as soon
as it was over, the wise women presented the infant with
their wonderful gifts: one with virtue, another with beauty,
a third with riches, and so on, so that the child had everything
that is to be desired in the world. Just as eleven
had given their presents, the thirteenth old lady stepped in
suddenly. She was in a tremendous passion because she
had not been invited, and, without greeting any one or looking
at any one, she exclaimed loudly, “The princess shall
prick herself with a spindle on her fifteenth birthday and
shall die!” and without a word further she turned her back
and left the hall. All were terrified, but the twelfth fairy,
who had not yet given her wish, then stepped up. Because
she could not take away the evil wish, but could only soften
it, she said, “She shall not die, but shall fall into a sleep of
a hundred years’ duration.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The king, who naturally wished to protect his child from
this misfortune, issued a decree commanding that every
spindle in the kingdom should be burnt. Meanwhile all
the gifts of the wise women were fulfilled, and the maiden
became so beautiful, gentle, virtuous, and clever, that
every one who saw her fell in love with her. It happened
on the day when she was just fifteen years old that the queen
and the king were not at home, and so she was left alone in
the castle. The maiden looked about in every place, going
through all the rooms and chambers just as she pleased,
until she came at last to an old tower. Up the narrow
winding staircase she tripped until she arrived at a door,
in the lock of which was a rusty key. This she turned, and
the door sprang open, and there in the little room sat an
old woman with a spindle, spinning flax.</p>

<p>“Good day to you,” said the princess, “what is this that
you are doing here?”</p>

<p>“I am spinning,” said the old woman, nodding her head.</p>

<p>“What thing is that which twists round so merrily?” inquired
the maiden, and she took the spindle to try her hand
at spinning. Scarcely had she done so when the prophecy
was fulfilled, for she pricked her finger; and at the very
same moment she fell back in a deep sleep upon a bed which
stood near. This sleep extended over the whole palace.
The king and queen, who had just come in, fell asleep in the
hall, and all their courtiers with them; the horses in the
stables, the doves upon the eaves, the flies upon the walls,
and even the fire upon the hearth, all ceased to stir; the
meat which was cooking ceased to frizzle; and the cook at
the instant of pulling the hair of the kitchen boy lost his
hold and began to snore, too. The wind also fell entirely,
and not a leaf rustled on the trees round the castle.</p>

<p>Now around the palace a thick hedge of briers began
growing, which every year grew higher and higher, till the
castle was quite hidden from view, so that one could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
even see the flag upon the tower. Then there went a legend
through the land, of the beautiful maiden Brier Rose, for
so was the sleeping princess named, and from time to time
princes came, endeavoring to penetrate through the hedge
into the castle; but it was not possible, for the thorns held
them as if by hands, and the youths were unable to release
themselves, and so perished miserably.</p>

<p>After the lapse of many years, there came another king’s
son into the country, and heard an old man tell the legend
of the hedge of briers; how that behind it stood a castle
where slept a wonderfully beauteous princess called Brier
Rose, who had slumbered nearly a hundred years, and with
her the queen and king and all their court. The old man
further related what he had heard from his grandfather,
that many princes had come and tried to penetrate the
hedge, and had died a miserable death. But the youth was
not to be daunted, and, however much the old man tried
to dissuade him, he would not listen, but cried out, “I fear
not, I will see this hedge of briers!”</p>

<p>Just at that time came the last day of the hundred years,
when Brier Rose was to wake again. As the young prince
approached the hedge, the thorns turned to fine large flowers,
which of their own accord made a way for him to pass
through, and again closed up behind him. In the courtyard
he saw the horses and dogs lying fast asleep, and on the
eaves were the doves with their heads beneath their wings.
As soon as he went into the house, there were the flies asleep
upon the wall, the cook still stood with his hands on the hair
of the kitchen boy, and the maid stood at the board with
the unplucked fowl in her hand. He went on, and in the
hall he found the courtiers lying asleep, and above, by the
throne, were the king and queen. He went on farther, and
all was so quiet that he could hear himself breathe, until
at last he came to the tower and opened the door of the
little room where slept Brier Rose. There she lay, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
so beautiful that he could not turn away his eyes, and he
bent over her and kissed her. Just as he did so she opened
her eyes, awoke, and greeted him with smiles. Then they
went down together, and immediately the king and queen
awoke, and the whole court, and all stared at each other
wonderingly. Now the horses in the stable got up and
shook themselves; the dogs wagged their tails; the doves
upon the eaves drew their heads from under their wings,
looked around, and flew away; the flies upon the walls
began to crawl; the fire began to burn brightly and to cook
the meat; the meat began again to frizzle; the cook gave
his lad a box upon the ear which made him call out; and the
maid began to pluck the fowl furiously. The whole palace
was once more in motion as if nothing had occurred, for
the hundred years’ sleep had made no change in any one.</p>

<p>By and by the wedding of the prince with Brier Rose was
celebrated with great splendor, and to the end of their lives
they lived happily and contented.</p>

<h4>THE COAT OF ALL COLORS</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from Grimm</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Thuringian Wonder Tale</i>)</p>

<p>There was once a king whose wife had golden hair and
was altogether so beautiful that her equal was not to be
found in the world. It happened that she fell ill, and when
she felt she must soon die she called the king and said, “If
you marry again after my death, take no one who is not as
beautiful as I have been, nor one who has not golden hair
like mine, and this you must promise me.” After the king
had promised she closed her eyes, and soon died.</p>

<p>For a long time the king would not be comforted and
thought not of taking a second wife, but his councillors at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
last said that he must marry again. Then messengers
were sent far and wide to seek a bride who should be as
beautiful as the late queen, but there was no one to be found
in the whole world so beautiful and with such golden hair.
So the messengers returned home without accomplishing
anything.</p>

<p>Now the king had a daughter who was just as beautiful
as her dead mother. She had also the same golden hair, and,
as she grew up, the king saw how like she was to his lost
wife. He told his councilors that he wished to marry his
daughter to his oldest councilor, and that she should be as
queen. When the oldest councilor heard this he was delighted.
But the daughter was frightened at the resolve
of the king, and hoped yet to turn him from his intention.
So she said to him, “Before I fulfill your wish I must first
have three dresses: one as golden as the sun, another as
silver as the moon, and a third as shining as the stars;
further, I desire a cloak composed of thousands of skins
and hides, and to which every beast in your kingdom must
contribute a portion of his skin.”</p>

<p>The princess thought this would be impossible to do, and
so she should reclaim her father from his intention. But
the king would not give it up, and the cleverest maidens
in his kingdom had to weave the three dresses, one as golden
as the sun, a second as silver as the moon, and a third as
shining as the stars, while his huntsmen had to catch all the
beasts in the whole kingdom and from each take a piece
of skin wherewith a mantle of a thousand pieces was made.
At length, when all was ready, the king let the mantle be
fetched, and, spreading it before him, said, “Tomorrow
shall the wedding be.”</p>

<p>When the king’s daughter now saw that there was no hope
left of turning her father from his resolve, she determined
to flee away. In the night, while all slept, she got up and
took three of her treasures, a golden ring, a gold spinning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
wheel, and a gold reel; she put also in a nutshell the three
dresses of the sun, moon, and stars, and putting on the
mantle of all skins, she dyed her hands and face black with
soot. Then, commending herself to God, she set off and
traveled the whole night till she came to a large wood, where,
feeling very tired, she took refuge in a hollow tree and went
to sleep. The sun rose, and she still slept and slept on till
it was again far into the morning. Then it happened that
the king who owned this forest came to hunt in it. As
soon as his dogs ran to the tree they snapped about it,
barked, and growled, so that the king said to his huntsmen,
“See what wild animal it is that is concealed there.” The
hunters obeyed his orders, and, when they returned, they
said, “In that hollow lies a wonderful creature whose like
we have never before seen; its skin is composed of a thousand
different colors, but it lies quite quiet and asleep.”
The king said, “Try if you can catch it alive, and then bind
it to the carriage, and we will take it with us.”</p>

<p>As soon as the hunters caught hold of the maiden, she
awoke full of terror, and called out to them, “I am a poor
child forsaken by both father and mother! Pray pity me,
and take me with you!” They named her “Allerleirauh,”
because of her mantle, and took her home with them to
serve in the kitchen and rake out the ashes. They went
to the royal palace, and there they showed her a little stable
under the step where no daylight could enter, and told
her she could live and sleep there. Afterwards she went
into the kitchen, and there she had to carry water and
wood to make the fire, to pluck the fowls, to peel the
vegetables, to rake out the ashes, and to do all manner of
dirty work.</p>

<p>Here, for a length of time, Allerleirauh lived wretchedly;
but it happened once that a feast was held in the palace,
and she asked the cook, “May I go and look on for a little
while? I will place myself just outside the door.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
cook said, “Yes, but in half an hour’s time you must return
and rake out the ashes.”</p>

<p>Allerleirauh took an oil lamp, and, going to her stable,
put off the gown of skins and washed the soot from her face
and hands so that her real beauty was displayed. Then she
opened her nut and took out the dress which shone as the
sun, and as soon as she was ready she went up to the ballroom,
where every one made way for her, supposing that she
was certainly some princess. The king himself soon came
up to her, and, taking her hand, danced with her, thinking
the while in his heart that he had never seen any one like
her. As soon as the dance was finished she disappeared,
and nobody knew whither. The watchmen stationed at the
gates were called and questioned, but they had not seen
her.</p>

<p>She had run back to her stable and, having quickly taken
off her dress, had again blackened her face and hands, put
on the dress of all skins, and became “Allerleirauh” once
more. As soon as she went into the kitchen to do her work
in sweeping up the ashes, the cook said, “Let that be for
once till the morning, and cook the king’s supper for me instead,
while I go upstairs to have a peep; but mind you do
not let one of your hairs fall in, or you will get nothing to
eat for the future.”</p>

<p>So saying, he went away, and Allerleirauh cooked the
king’s supper, making some soup as good as she possibly
could, and when it was ready she went into the stable, and
fetched her gold ring, and laid it in the dish. When the
dance was at an end, the king ordered his supper to be
brought, which, when he had tasted, he thought he had
never eaten anything so nice before. Just as he nearly
finished it he saw a gold ring at the bottom, and, not being
able to imagine how it came there, he commanded the cook
to be brought before him. The cook was terrified when he
heard this order, and said to Allerleirauh, “Are you certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
you did not let a hair fall into the soup? For if it is so,
you will catch a beating.”</p>

<p>Then he came before the king, who asked who had cooked
the supper, and he answered, “I did.” But the king said,
“That is not true; for it is of a much better kind and much
better cooked than usual.” Then the cook said, “I must
confess that not I, but Allerleirauh, cooked it.” So that
the king commanded that she should be brought up.</p>

<p>When Allerleirauh came, the king asked, “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I am a poor child, without father or mother,” replied
she.</p>

<p>“Why did you come to my palace?” then inquired the
king.</p>

<p>“I am good for nothing else but to have the boots thrown
at my head,” said she.</p>

<p>The king asked again, “Where did you get this ring,
then, which was in the soup?”</p>

<p>Allerleirauh said, “I know nothing of it.” And, as she
would say no more, she was at last sent away.</p>

<p>After a time there was another ball, and Allerleirauh
asked the cook’s permission to go again and look on, and he
consented, and told her, “Return here in half an hour to
cook the king again the same soup which he liked so much
before.”</p>

<p>Allerleirauh ran into the stable and, washing herself
quickly, took out of the shell the dress which was silver as
the moon, and put it on. Then she went up to the ballroom
and appeared like a princess, and the king, stepping
up to her, was very glad to see her again; and, as the dancing
had just begun, they joined it. But as soon as it was
over, his partner disappeared so quickly that the king did
not notice where she went. She ran to her stable and
changed her garments again, and then went into the kitchen
to make the soup. While the cook was upstairs, she fetched
the golden spinning wheel and put it in the tureen, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the soup was served up with it. Afterwards it was brought
before the king, who ate it, and found it tasted as good as
the former; and the cook was called, who was obliged to
confess again that Allerleirauh had made it. Allerleirauh
was accordingly taken before the king, but she repeated
what she had before said, that she was of no use but to have
boots thrown at her, and that she knew nothing of the gold
spinning wheel.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards a third feast was given by the king,
at which everything went as before. The cook said to
Allerleirauh when she asked leave to go, “You are certainly
a witch, and always put something in the soup which makes
it taste better than mine. Still, since you beg so hard, you
shall go at the usual time.” This time she put on the dress
shining as the stars, and stepped with it into the ballroom.
The king danced again with her, and thought he had never
seen any maiden so beautiful, and while the dance went on
he slipped the gold ring on to her finger without her perceiving
it and told the musicians to prolong the time. When
at last it ended, he would have kept fast hold of her hand,
but she tore herself away, and sprang so quickly in among
the people that she disappeared from his sight. Allerleirauh
ran as well as she could back to her stable; but she had stayed
over and above the half hour, and she had not time to pull
off her beautiful dress, but was obliged to throw over it her
cloak of skins. Neither did she quite finish the blacking of
her skin, but left one finger white. Then she ran into the
kitchen, cooked the soup for the king, and put in it the reel,
while the cook stayed upstairs. Afterwards, when the king
found the reel at the bottom of his soup, he summoned
Allerleirauh, and perceived at once her white finger, and the
ring which he had put on it during the dance. He took her
by the hand and held her fast, and when she tried to force
herself from him and run away, her cloak of skins fell partly
off and the starry dress was displayed to view. The king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
then pulled the cloak wholly off, and down came her golden
hair, and there she stood in all her beauty, and could no
longer conceal herself. As soon, then, as the soot and
ashes were washed off her face, she stood up and appeared
more beautiful than any one could conceive possible on earth.
But the king said to her, “You are my dear bride, and we
will never separate from each other.” Thereupon was the
wedding celebrated, and they lived happily to the end of
their lives.</p>

<h4>THE POOR MAN AND THE RICH MAN</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from Grimm</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Folk Tale—Ethics, teaching kindness</i>)</p>

<p>In olden times, when the good angels walked the earth in
the form of men, it happened that one of them, while he was
wandering about very tired, saw night coming upon him
before he had found a shelter. But there stood on the road
close by two houses opposite to one another, one of which
was large and handsome, while the other appeared miserably
poor. The former belonged to a rich man, and the
other to a poor man, so that the angel thought he could
lodge with the former, because it would be less burdensome
to him than to the other to entertain a guest. Accordingly
he knocked at the door, and the rich man, opening the
window, asked the stranger what he sought. The angel
replied, “I seek a night’s lodging.” Then the rich man
scanned the stranger from head to foot, and perceiving that
he wore ragged clothes, and seemed like one who had not
much money in his pocket, he shook his head and said, “I
cannot take you in; my rooms are full of herbs and seeds,
and, should I shelter every one who knocks at my door, I
might soon take the beggar’s staff into my own hand. Seek
a welcome elsewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, he shut his window to, and left the good angel,
who immediately turned his back upon him and went over
to the little house. Here he had scarcely knocked, when
the door was opened and the poor man bade the wanderer
welcome, and said, “Stop here this night with me; it is
quite dark, and today you can go no farther.” This reception
pleased the angel much, and he walked in; and the wife
of the poor man also bade him welcome and, holding out
her hand, said, “Make yourself at home, and though it is
not much that we have, we will give it to you with all our
heart.” Then she placed some potatoes at the fire, and
while they roasted she milked her goat for something to
drink with them. When the table was laid, the good angel
sat down and ate with them, and the rude fare tasted good,
because they who partook of it had happy faces. After
they had finished, when bedtime came, the wife called the
husband aside and said to him, “Let us sleep tonight on
straw, my dear, that this poor wanderer may have our bed
whereon to rest himself, for he has been walking all day
long, and is doubtless very tired.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” replied her husband; “I will offer
it to him;” and, going up to the angel, he begged him, if he
pleased, to lie in their bed that he might rest his limbs
thoroughly. The good angel at first refused to take the bed
of his hosts, but at last he yielded to their entreaties and lay
down, while they made a straw couch upon the ground.
The next morning they arose early and cooked their guest a
breakfast of the best that they had, and when the sun shone
through the window he got up, too, and, after eating with
them, prepared to set out again. When he stood in the doorway
he turned round and said to his hosts, “Because you
are so compassionate and pious, you may wish three times
and I will grant, each time, what you desire.”</p>

<p>The poor man replied, “Ah, what else can I wish than
eternal happiness, and that we two, so long as we live, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
have health and strength and our necessary daily bread?
For the third thing I know not what to wish.”</p>

<p>“Will you not wish for a new house in place of this old
one?” asked the angel.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said the man, “if I may keep on this spot, so
would it be welcome.”</p>

<p>Then the good angel fulfilled his wishes and changed their
old house into a new one, and, giving them once more his
blessing, went out of the house.</p>

<p>It was already broad daylight when the rich man arose
and, looking out of his window, saw a handsome new house
of red brick where formerly an old hut had stood. The
sight made him open his eyes, and he called his wife
up and asked, “Tell me what has happened; yesterday
evening an old, miserable hut stood opposite, and today
there is a fine new house! Run out and hear how this has
happened!”</p>

<p>The wife went and asked the poor man, who related that
the evening before a wanderer had come, seeking a night’s
lodging, and that in the morning he had taken his leave,
and granted them three wishes—eternal happiness, health
and food during their lives, and instead of their old hut, a
fine new house. When he had finished his tale, the wife of
the rich man ran home and told her husband all that had
passed, and he exclaimed, “Ah! had I only known it! The
stranger had been here before, and would have passed the
night with us, but I sent him away.”</p>

<p>“Hasten, then!” returned his wife. “Mount your horse,
and perhaps you may overtake the man, and then you must
ask three wishes for yourself also.”</p>

<p>The rich man followed this advice, and soon overtook the
angel. He spoke softly and glibly, begging that the angel
would not take it ill that he had not let him in at first, for
that he had gone to seek the key of the house door, and
meanwhile he had gone away, but if the angel came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the same way he would be glad if he would call again. The
angel promised that he would come on his return, and the
rich man then asked if he might not wish thrice as his neighbor
had been allowed. “Yes,” said the angel, “you may
certainly, but it will not be good for you, and it were better
you did not wish.”</p>

<p>But the rich man thought he might easily obtain something
which would tend to his happiness, if he only knew
that it would be fulfilled, and so the angel at length said,
“Ride home, and the three wishes which you shall make
shall be answered.”</p>

<p>The rich man now had what he desired, and, as he rode
homewards, began to consider what he should wish. While
he thought he let his rein fall loose, and his horse presently
began to jump, so that he was jerked about, and so much
so that he could fix his mind on nothing. He patted his
horse on the neck, and said, “Be quiet, Bess!” but it only
began fresh friskings, so that at last he became savage, and
cried quite impatiently, “I wish you might break your
neck!” No sooner had he said so than down it fell upon
the ground and never moved again, and thus the first wish
was fulfilled. But the rich man, being covetous by nature,
would not leave the saddle behind, and so, cutting it off,
he slung it over his back and went onwards on foot. “You
still have two wishes,” thought he to himself, and so was
comforted, but as he slowly passed over the sandy common
the sun scorched him terribly, for it was midday, and he
soon became vexed and passionate; moreover, the saddle
hurt his back; and besides, he had not yet decided what to
wish for. “If I should wish for all the treasures and riches
in the world,” said he to himself, “hereafter something or
other will occur to me, I know beforehand; but I will so
manage that nothing at all shall remain for me to wish for.”</p>

<p>Many times he thought he knew what to wish, but soon
it appeared too little. Then it came into his thoughts how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
well his wife was situated, sitting at home in a cool room,
and appropriately dressed. This idea angered him uncommonly,
and, without knowing it, he said aloud, “I wish
she were sitting upon this saddle, and could not get off it,
instead of its being slipping about on my back.”</p>

<p>As soon as these words were out of his mouth, the saddle
disappeared from his back, and he perceived that his second
wish had passed its fulfillment. Now he became very hot,
and began to run, intending to lock himself up in his room
and consider there something great for his last wish. But
when he arrived and opened the house door he found his
wife sitting upon the saddle in the middle of the room, and
crying and shrieking because she could not get off. So he
said to her, “Be contented; I will wish for the riches in all
the world, only keep sitting there.”</p>

<p>But his wife shook her head, saying, “Of what use are all
the riches of the world to me, if I sit upon this saddle?
You have wished me on it, and you must also wish me
off.”</p>

<p>So, whether he liked it or not, he was forced to utter his
third wish, that his wife might be freed from the saddle,
and immediately it was done. Thus the rich man gained
nothing from his wishes but vexation, trouble, scolding, and
a lost horse; but the poor people lived contented and pious
to their lives’ end.</p>

<h4>THE SILVER CONES</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Adapted from Story by Johanna Spyri</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Ethics—Geography</i>)</p>

<p>In the mountain land of Bohemia there lived in the long
ago a miner with his wife and little daughter. They were
happy in their hut in the forest, but after a time the father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and mother died, and the child was left alone in the world.
She had no money, and no aunts or cousins to take her in,
and it seemed as if she would have to go hungry. But always
there are kindly hearts among the poor, and one of the
miners opened his house that she might have a home. He
had six children of his own and little bread and meat to spare,
but his good wife said, “We will divide what we have.”
So little Hilda became one of the family, and they grew to
love her very much.</p>

<p>It was midwinter, and Christmas day not far away. The
children thought of nothing but the coming of St. Nicholas,
who they hoped would not forget them on the Holy Night,
when every boy and girl in Bohemia expects a visit from
the gift bringer. But when they spoke to the miner about
it he shook his head and said, “Do not set your hearts upon
his coming. Our hut is very small and stands so far in the
forest that he may not be able to find it.”</p>

<p>Gretchen, his little daughter, had a very different idea.
She declared St. Nicholas could find a house in the dark if
it were no bigger than an ant hill, and went to bed to dream
of the toys and sweetmeats he would bring.</p>

<p>Day after day passed, and nearer, nearer came the season
of Christ’s birth. The children talked of him as they sat
by the fire at night, as they picked up dead branches in the
forest, and as they bedded the goats and shut them in, for
Bohemian mountain folk are a toiling people, and even boys
and girls must work.</p>

<p>At last the day before Christmas came, and in the afternoon
little Hilda started out with her basket to get some
cones. She wanted the fire to be brighter and more cheerful
than ever that night, and perhaps if she met a servant from
the castle, he might take some to feed the prince’s fire, and
give her a silver piece.</p>

<p>“And if he does,” she thought as she trudged on her way,
“I can buy something for the miner and his dear children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, in that land of Bohemia, on the summit of a lofty
mountain, a creature named Rübezahl made his home.
He possessed all magic powers, and was so mighty that his
sway extended to the very center of the earth. There he
had chambers of gold and silver, and diamonds and jewels
without number, and often gave of his treasures to those
who were good enough to deserve them. He could change
himself at will into any form. Now he was a bat flying in
the night, now a country swain selling his wares at the fair,
and now a woodman cutting down trees in the forest, because
thus he was able to find out who was worthy and who
unworthy, and to reward or punish them as they deserved.</p>

<p>Hilda had often heard of the strange ways of Rübezahl,
and wondered if he would ever cross her path.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” she murmured, “because I am just a
little girl.”</p>

<p>As she came near the fir trees, a tiny white-haired man
walked out of the shadow. He had a long white beard and
a jolly red face, and looked as if he were the friend of children.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” he called to her.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to gather cones,” she replied; “some for our
fire and some to sell, if the servant from the castle will only
buy.”</p>

<p>Then she told him of the miner’s family, of how eager she
was to get some money that she might buy a gift for his children,
and of her hope that St. Nicholas would not forget
them on the Holy Night.</p>

<p>The little old man seemed much interested, and when she
finished her story he said, “The largest cones are on that
tree. If you hope to sell, gather the best ones.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a great, dark fir just beyond them, and
then went back into the shadows of the forest.</p>

<p>Little Hilda thanked him and ran to the spot. She could
see the cones like beehives on the branches, and just as she
came under them there was such a downfall of beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
brown things it frightened her and she began to run. But
thinking of what she could do with such big ones, she went
back, filled her basket, and started homeward.</p>

<p>It was very heavy, and the farther she went the heavier it
grew.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to ask little Gretchen to help me take it up
the hill path to the castle,” she thought. But by the time
she reached the hut it had become such a load she could
not move it, and the miner had to carry it in himself.</p>

<p>“They are lovely big ones and of a beautiful brown
color,” she said as the children crowded around to see.</p>

<p>But when they looked at the basket again, they saw no
brown at all. Instead there was a gleam brighter than that
of the moonbeams through the fir trees, for a wonderful
thing had happened. In the twinkling of an eye every one
of those cones had turned into shining silver, which sparkled
and glistened so that they dazzled the eyes.</p>

<p>Then the little girl remembered the old man in the forest
and told the miner about him.</p>

<p>He nodded his head in a knowing way and said, “Surely
it was Rübezahl, and he has rewarded you for being sweet
and gentle.”</p>

<p>All of which seemed like a dream to little Hilda, but
when she looked into the basket she knew it was true. And
so knew all the other mountain folk, when the stars of the
Holy Night shone out and the children went from door to
door distributing silver cones. The good folk who gave
her a home received so many that never again were they
poor. They built a fine house with a porch and twenty
windows, and were as rich as any one in Bohemia.</p>

<p>To make things lovelier still, St. Nicholas found the hut,
just as Gretchen had said he would, and left some sweets
and toys for the children. He laughed loud and long when
he saw the shining cones, for he had heard all about it from
Rübezahl himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>This all happened very, very long ago, in the time so far
away that even the oldest grandmother cannot remember
the Holy Night when Hilda gave precious gifts to the miners;
but the story has come down from the fathers and the fathers’
fathers, and that is why, even to this day, the mountain folk
of Bohemia still deck their Christmas trees with silvered
cones.</p>

<h4>THE FORGET-ME-NOT</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Adapted from Version by Hoffman von
Fallersleben</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Thuringian Folk Tale—Helpful in Nature Study</i>)</p>

<p>In the beginning of things, when God the Father created
every beast of the forest and every bird and tree and blossom,
he gave each one a name, and the snowdrop, the lily, the
pansy, the violet, and all the other flower sisterhood rejoiced
and were glad, for each thought its own name the
loveliest in the world. Everywhere in field and woodland
there was happiness, and the blossoms lifted their faces
toward heaven in gratitude, thanking the Gracious Giver.</p>

<p>But suddenly there was a sound of weeping. Somewhere
in the meadow a flower had raised its voice in sorrow, and
all the other flowers looked to see. At first they could not
tell whence the sound came, then they beheld a tiny blossom,
with petals the color of heaven and a heart the color of gold.
It was sobbing bitterly, and the lily, looking down in pity,
asked, “Why weepest thou?”</p>

<p>“Alas,” came the reply, “I have forgotten my name.”
Then—wonderful sound—the primrose and the violet and
the pansy heard the voice of God the Father, for although
the blossom was very tiny and half hidden by the grasses of
the field, He heard and saw and knew.</p>

<p>“Forgotten your name?” He spake in tones that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
sweet and tender. “Then shalt thou be called ‘Forget-me-not,’
for that thou canst always remember.”</p>

<p>“Forget-me-not,” repeated the gorgeous rose and the
modest violet, and the tiny one smiled through its tears and
said, “Forget-me-not.”</p>

<p>And ever since that day at creation time, when God the
Father named every beast of the forest and every bird and
flower and tree, the wee blossom whose petals are the color
of heaven and whose heart is the color of gold, has been called
“Forget-me-not.”</p>

<h4>THE LITTLE STEPMOTHER</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Thuringian Folk Tale—Nature Study</i>)</p>

<p>Once upon a time, say the peasants of the Rhineland, a
woodman lived with his wife and two daughters in a little
hut in the forest. They were very poor, but what mattered
that, since they were very happy?</p>

<p>They had five chairs,—one apiece, and one for company,—clean,
sweet feather beds to keep them warm at night, a
bit of soup to eat with their black bread, and once each year
they went to the fair.</p>

<p>But after a time the mother died, and things were different.
The father took another wife, who had two children of her
own, and she was very unkind to her husband’s little
daughters. She forced them to do all the work, and if the
poor woodman so much as opened his mouth to object, she
beat him with her slipper. You will know how greedy she
was when I tell you that she took two of the fine wood chairs
for her own children and kept two for herself, and you remember
there were only five in the hut. That left one for
the husband and his daughters, and as the father was kind
and good, he let them have it all to themselves and patiently
stood while he ate his meals.</p>

<p>For a long time that greedy little stepmother ruled her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
husband and his children with an iron hand, while her own
daughters acted like spoiled princesses, until one night something
happened. The hut and the family disappeared.
Just how it came to pass, nobody knows, but the next morning
the other woodmen found a little flower growing where
the house had stood, and they knew that a fairy or witch or
something had turned the family into the blossom which
you may see almost any summer day. The greedy stepmother
still sits on her two chairs, with her children on each
side of her holding a chair apiece. The woodman’s little
daughters are crowded together on one, just as they were in
the hut. And what of the poor henpecked husband, who
did not dare to object to anything his spouse chose to do?
Look in the center, right under her slipper, and you will
find what most people say is the pistil. But the peasants
of the Rhineland know better. It is the woodman, who
once upon a time lived in the hut in the forest, and the flower
you call the pansy is to them “The Little Stepmother.”</p>

<h4>THE RABBIT AND THE EASTER EGGS</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Bavarian Folk Tale</i>)</p>

<p>Once, in the German land of Bavaria, there was a mother
who was very poor. She was sad as Easter time drew near,
for it was the custom in that land to give presents then just
as we do at Christmas, and she had nothing for her children.
She grieved about it day and night, and one day was so unhappy
over it that she wept.</p>

<p>“Never fear,” the old grandmother said, “the hens are
laying well, and I know how to make beautiful dyes from
moss and leaves. We can color some eggs for Hans and
Annchen, and they will be happy.”</p>

<p>This was a lovely thought to the poor mother, and she
went to work. Soon she had beautiful red, blue, yellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
purple, and orange eggs, and when Easter morning came
she and the grandmother hid them in a nest in the woods.
It was a lovely spot, with a thick carpet of moss underfoot
and the snowy blossoms of the wild plum overhead.</p>

<p>Then they all went to the tiny chapel that stood at the
other side of the village, to listen to the music and hear the
good pastor tell the story of Easter day, after which they
walked home by the woodland path.</p>

<p>Little Hans and Annchen were running ahead of the others,
and all at once they called, “Oh, Mother, Grandmother,
come!”</p>

<p>The good mother said, “They must have found the eggs,”
and hurried to see.</p>

<p>Yes, there the children knelt, bending over the nest of
eggs lovelier than they had ever seen.</p>

<p>“They are beautiful, Mother!” exclaimed Hans. “See,
they look like hen’s eggs, yet they are every color, like the
rainbow. How did they get here in the woods?”</p>

<p>“I know,” cried little Annchen. “A fairy bird laid them.”</p>

<p>Just then a rabbit leaped out of some tall grass behind
the nest, and hopped away into the forest.</p>

<p>The children screamed with delight. “The rabbit laid
the eggs! The rabbit laid the eggs!” they shouted.</p>

<p>And ever since that time Bavarian children have played
that rabbits lay Easter eggs.</p>

<h4>THE EASTER EGGS</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Adapted from Story by Canon Schmidt</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>During the days of the Crusades a little village stood in the
heart of a little valley. The people living there were very
poor, but so good and gentle that despite their poverty they
were happier than many of the great folk of the realm. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
had none of the cares that trouble the rich. Their rude
black huts, each with its tiny garden plot and bit of meadow
land where they pastured the cow or goats, satisfied them
because they knew nothing else, and they lived so simply
and healthfully that there were men over a hundred years
of age among them. Sometimes they burned charcoal for
the iron works in the mountains and earned a few pennies,
when they felt rich indeed, but if there was no money they
did not complain. They ate their vegetables and black
bread and drank their goat’s milk in contentment.</p>

<p>One day, when the corn ears were yellowing, a little girl
hurried down the mountain side where she had been tending
goats. She ran to her home at the edge of the village, and
called to her mother in the garden, “Oh, mamma, come
quickly! A beautiful woman with two pretty children is
waiting for me on the mountain. They are very tired and
hungry, and she asked me for some bread and milk.”</p>

<p>Kind hearts beat in the breasts of those village folk, and
although they had little themselves, they were always ready
to share their small store. Quickly the mother filled a jar
with goat’s milk and took some bread, butter, and cheese,
and she and her husband followed the little daughter up the
mountain side. After a while they came to a turn in the
path, and saw a woman, very young and very beautiful,
sitting on a rock under a beech tree. She was holding a
little girl who was as lovely as herself, and beside them, on
the ground, a tiny dark-eyed boy played with a bunch of
thistles. Not far away an old man was unloading a mule
and opening bundles as if preparing to camp for the night.
Their clothing was of the costly kind that is worn only by
the very rich, and it seemed strange that they should be
asking food of the poor.</p>

<p>The village wife offered the bread, butter, and cheese
she had brought with her, which the woman received with
smiles and words of thanks. She kept nothing herself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
gave all to the old man and children, who ate the coarse
peasant fare as if it tasted very good, and as she watched
them tears streamed down her cheeks. She asked many
questions about the valley, and finding that no one but
charcoal burners lived there, and that strangers almost never
came by, exclaimed, “I think God must have sent me here.
I have been driven from home and am seeking a spot where
we may rest in peace.”</p>

<p>They went down to the valley together, and the peasant
and his wife led the way to a vacant house, which the woman
rented for her home. It was a very humble cottage, but she
said it suited her, for it was new and clean, and from its little
windows one could see out over the cabins and the garden
plots to the tall, dark fir trees on the mountain slopes. She
took one of the village girls for a servant, and the worn, unhappy
look began to leave her face.</p>

<p>Early the next morning she called the maid Marie, gave
her a silver piece, and said, “Go and get some eggs for breakfast.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, madame!” she asked sorrowfully, “do you mean
that I must take the eggs of the dear little birds that sing
in the forest?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” her mistress replied, thinking her very
silly, “I want hen’s eggs, not bird’s eggs.”</p>

<p>But Marie looked more amazed than before.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean by ‘hens,’” she said. “We
have none of them here.”</p>

<p>“You have no hens!” the woman exclaimed. “How can
that be?”</p>

<p>Then she remembered that this was a village of poor
peasants and that only the rich had chickens, because they
had just been brought to Europe from Asia, and were very
costly. So she bade the old man Kuno go to the city across
the mountains and bring her everything she needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“And be sure not to forget the cock and hens,” she called
after him as he rode away.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon the man returned, and the woman
met him at the door. “Have you brought the chickens?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Nodding in reply, he set the cage on the ground.</p>

<p>By this time the village children had gathered around, and
were greatly excited about the strange-looking birds. They
laughed and clapped their hands, for they never had seen
anything like them, and when Kuno turned them out of the
cage and they walked around picking up the grain he threw
to them, their joy knew no bounds. Then the cock flapped
his wings and crowed and some of the hens cackled, and the
children danced and screamed in delight. They stayed
until it was dark, and early the next morning came again
and brought their fathers and mothers to see the wonderful
birds that sang such curious songs.</p>

<p>Summer passed and autumn came. The last apples fell
from the trees, nuts dropped in the frost-painted forest, and
the sharp winds of November blew down from the peaks,
yet still the lovely stranger and her children stayed in the
village. That was very strange, for the valley was entirely
surrounded by rugged mountains, and was a rough, wild
country in winter, when the tiny houses were almost buried
in the snow. But they seemed happy there, and the people
wondered much about it. They talked of it as they herded
the goats on the slopes, as they burned charcoal in the shadow
of the fir trees, and always would end by saying, “She is some
great lady, for she speaks the language of court, and she
and her children have costly clothes and many gold pieces.”</p>

<p>But they found out nothing, for when they asked the
children who their mother was they said, “She is mamma,
and we are Blanche and Edmund.”</p>

<p>So still they wondered and still they did not know. But
they were glad she lived among them, because they had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to love her very much. She was kind and charitable toward
every one in the village. She gave food to the poor and took
care of the sick, and the peasants repaid her with many
kindnesses. They gave her game they killed in the forest,
and when spring came and the snow melted, the village
children roamed the woods for the earliest violets and cowslips,
and brought them to her door.</p>

<p>These acts of kindness touched her, and the morning before
Easter she thought, “I must do something to make them
happy.” But what could it be? She couldn’t give them a
feast, because, although she had plenty of money, it was
impossible to get any meat in the village; and she couldn’t
give them presents, because there was no place to buy them.
She had nothing but eggs, which she thought would be no
treat at all. Then an idea came to her. Calling Marie,
the maid, she told her of it and they merrily went to work.</p>

<p>They went into the woods and gathered roots, moss, and
berries such as were used for dyeing in those days. They
made cakes and custards. They colored eggs red, blue,
green, orange, and lilac, and planned to give the people a
grand surprise. Late in the afternoon little Blanche and
Edmund went out through the village and stopped at every
house, saying, “Mamma invites you, you and all your family,
great and small, to a feast at our house tomorrow. Come
after the mass.”</p>

<p>Everybody accepted the invitation. They had never
been to a real feast, and to go to one at the house of the
lovely stranger would be fine indeed. They took out their
best holiday attire, polished their shoe buckles until they
shone, and made ready for a gala time, and on Easter morning
a line of men, women, and children went from the chapel
to the cottage of the lady.</p>

<p>She met them at the door and led them into the garden,
where two long tables were spread. The parents were told
to sit down, but she said to the children, “It is not time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
you to eat yet. Go into the woods with Edmund and
Blanche, and make little nests of moss. Put them under
the trees, and be sure to remember where you left them.”</p>

<p>They ran out laughing, and the parents sat down to the
feast, and a splendid feast it seemed to them! There were
eggs in the shell, fried eggs, eggs in milk, omelets, and sweet,
yellow custards, and as they never had tasted eggs before,
they thought them wonderfully delicious.</p>

<p>After a while the children came back for their share in the
good things, and as soon as they had finished eating, the
woman said, “Go out and look for your pretty nests.”</p>

<p>A rush and a scramble and they were in the woods, and a
moment later cries of delight and wonder were heard, for in
each nest they found five lovely eggs of red, blue, green,
purple, and orange. They came pell-mell to show them to
their fathers and mothers, who discovered something written
upon them.</p>

<p>It was a motto, and the villagers, who were too unlettered
to read it, asked the lady to tell them what it meant. They
smiled as they listened, as if believing in the truth of the
words they heard:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In God’s protecting goodness trust,</div>
<div class="verse">For He will aid the kind and just.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The afternoon passed joyously, and when the chapel bell
rang out the Angelus, the villagers departed, and the woman
stood in the doorway with a smile upon her face, watching
them go to their homes. While she watched, a youth carrying
a bundle came walking down the mountain path. He
seemed very tired and sad, and tears came into his eyes as
she called to him. He told her he was on his way to a village
beyond to see his mother, who was old and sick, and that he
had walked a long way without food.</p>

<p>“I have a little money,” he said, “but must not spend it
for myself, because it is needed at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Touched by his story, the woman took him into the house,
where a good meal was set before him; and as he was about
to start away, she gave him a gold piece and some eggs for
his little brother and sister.</p>

<p>Refreshed by rest and food he strode on his way through
the village, took the path that led to the other side of the
mountains, and after a while came to the edge of a ravine.
From that point the trail was narrow and dangerous, and he
walked rapidly because he wanted to reach home before night.</p>

<p>But suddenly he stopped. Looking down to where a tiny
stream wound through the gulch, he saw a horse. It was
saddled and bridled, which seemed very strange to him.</p>

<p>“I wonder if some one has fallen and needs help,” he
murmured.</p>

<p>So, although he wanted to be on his way, he climbed down
over the crags.</p>

<p>It was as he feared. A man was lying there, motionless
as if dead. He was dressed in heavy armor, by which the
lad knew he was some one rich and great.</p>

<p>Pulling off the helmet to use as a dipper, he ran to the river
for water, and poured it over the drawn, white face.</p>

<p>The rider opened his eyes slowly, and when he saw the
youth kneeling beside him said, “Thank God for sending
you! I fell down over the cliffs, and thought I was to lie
here and die. Oh, I am so weak and faint!” he sighed.</p>

<p>The peasant boy remembered the pretty eggs in his bundle
that were intended for his little brother and sister at home.
“But they would want me to give them to this poor fellow,”
he thought. So he shelled one and held it to the trembling
lips.</p>

<p>The man ate it as if nearly starved, and another and another.
Then, seeing the motto on the one that was still
unbroken, he opened his eyes wide.</p>

<p>“Stop,” he said as the boy was about to break it. “Let
me have it as it is and I will give you a gold piece for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the peasant youth, who was stalwart and strong,
helped him on to his horse, and led him to his own village,
where the doctor said he must lie still for six weeks. He
groaned as he heard those words, and exclaimed, “Six weeks,
and my master waiting for word of her!”</p>

<p>But he was a soldier, and knew how to wait. He stayed
patiently, and at the end of the time went on his way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the village in the valley, the beautiful
stranger lived on with her children. She seemed very happy
until one day the man Kuno went to the city across the
mountain, and returned looking pale and worried.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said as she met him at the door, “I have
bad news for you.”</p>

<p>She turned white, as if some terrible thing had happened,
took him into the house, and they talked together for a long
time. Then Kuno left the cottage and hurried through the
village to the house of the miller, who was also the mayor.</p>

<p>“My mistress wishes to speak to you,” he said.</p>

<p>The man went back with him, and when they reached the
house, the woman told a strange story.</p>

<p>“I am Rosalinde, daughter of the Duke of Burgundy,”
she said. “In my father’s court were two knights, Hanno
of Schraffeneck and Arno of Lindenburg, who were suitors
for my hand. I chose Arno, and Hanno was furiously angry.
He vowed he would have revenge, but I was happy with my
husband, and did not fear him.</p>

<p>“All went well for a long time. Then the emperor summoned
my husband to go on the Holy Wars to Palestine, and
he rode away with the Crusaders, leaving me alone with the
children. Hanno, too, was summoned to fight the Moslems,
but he stayed behind, vowing that now he would have his
revenge, and unless I married him he would put me into
prison and kill my children.</p>

<p>“The castle of my lord was strong, but there was no one
to defend it after he and his train went away, and Hanno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
brought many men and began a siege. My good Kuno,
who knew a secret passage, aided me to escape and brought
me across the mountains to your village, where I have felt
safe. But today he saw Hanno in the city, asking people
if a lady with two children and an old domestic had passed
that way.”</p>

<p>She stopped a moment as if she could not speak for tears,
then went on sadly, “Kuno hid and was not seen, but I fear
that when Hanno comes through the valley, the people will
tell him I am here, and then he will put me in prison and kill
my children.”</p>

<p>The miller shook his head and spoke words of comfort.</p>

<p>“Have no fear, madame,” he said. “The villagers will
not tell that you are here, and if Hanno comes and tries to
take you, we will defend you with our lives.”</p>

<p>Then he went from house to house, telling the story of the
Lady Rosalinde. Soon every one in the village knew it and
the people swore to protect her at any cost, and the next
day when Hanno came, they pretended to be so stupid that
they didn’t know what he was talking about.</p>

<p>“She has not been here,” he said to his men. And they
went away.</p>

<p>After that all was peaceful in the village, and the Lady
Rosalinde was no longer afraid. Her children played with
the charcoal burners’ children, and every evening they went
to the little chapel at the edge of the forest to pray for the
safe return of the husband and father from Palestine.</p>

<p>One lovely evening in the month of May, they went to
the church as usual, and when they came out, sat down on
some rocks to watch the sun sink behind the mountain. A
pilgrim came by, bending low over a staff, his long white
hair reaching his shoulders and his beard flowing down over
his breast. He noticed the children and spoke to them, and
little Edmund said, “We have just been to church to pray
for our dear papa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lady Rosalinde was terribly frightened, for she thought
he might be some one who would carry word to Hanno, but
a moment later her fear turned to joy, for the pilgrim snatched
off his beard and white hair, and a young, handsome knight
stood before them. Little Blanche and Edmund screamed
in delight, for they knew it was their father.</p>

<p>“How did you find us?” Lady Rosalinde asked.</p>

<p>“I found you, my dear Rosalinde, because you were good
and charitable.”</p>

<p>Then he told how he had returned from the Crusades to
a ruined castle.</p>

<p>“I questioned the peasants around, who said Hanno had
besieged it, and that you and the children had escaped.
Then I led my train against him and took him prisoner, and
sent out horsemen to find word of you. It seemed they
would never come back, and when they did my heart almost
broke, for although they had scoured the land they had no
news. There was one, however, who did not return, and
thinking he had been killed, I gave up hope. But six weeks
later he came with a strange story, and gave me a colored
egg, and imagine my joy, to find upon it in your own handwriting,
the motto of my house:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In God’s protecting goodness trust,</div>
<div class="verse">For He will aid the kind and just.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, continuing the story, Lord Arno told how he had
gone in the guise of a pilgrim to the home of the peasant
from whom the cavalier received the egg, and learning that
his wife and children were in the valley, had come seeking
them.</p>

<p>Word that the lovely woman had been found by her husband
soon traveled throughout the village, and the people,
young and old, came to welcome him.</p>

<p>He was a true and valiant knight and thanked them for
their kindness to his loved ones, for the Lady Rosalinde had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
told him of her stay in the valley, and of how good and gentle
the peasants were.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear friends,” he said, “to show you how
grateful I am, I promise to give a fine, big cow to every
family in the village. And every year at Easter time, my
wife and I will send colored eggs to the children, not only
to those of this valley, but to every boy and girl in the realm.”</p>

<p>Then Lord Arno and his family departed, rebuilt their
ruined castle, and lived happily there. But they never forgot
the charcoal burners in the valley, and every year sent
quantities of gay eggs to the children. As years passed
the custom spread from country to country, until now
colored eggs are given at Easter time to children in every
Christian land.</p>

<h4>PRINCE UNEXPECTED</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From the Polish of Glinski</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Slavic Wonder Tale</i>)</p>

<p>There were a king and a queen who had been married for
three years, but had no children, at which they were both
much distressed. Once upon a time the king found himself
obliged to make a visit of inspection round his dominions;
he took leave of his queen, set off, and was not at home for
eight months.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the ninth month the king returned
from his progress through his country, and was already hard
by his capital city, when, as he journeyed over an uninhabited
plain during the most scorching heat of summer, he
felt such excessive thirst that he sent his servants round
about to see if they could find water anywhere and let him
know of it at once. The servants dispersed in various directions,
sought in vain for a whole hour, and returned without
success to the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The thirst-tormented king proceeded to traverse the
whole plain far and wide himself, not believing that there
was not a spring somewhere or other; on he rode, and on a
level spot, on which there had not previously been any
water, he espied a well with a new wooden fence round it,
full to the brim with spring water, in the midst of which
floated a silver cup with a golden handle. The king sprang
from his horse and reached after the cup with his right hand;
but the cup, just as if it were alive and had eyes, darted
quickly on one side and floated again by itself. The king
knelt down and began to try to catch it, now with his right
hand, now with his left, but it moved and dodged away in
such a manner that, not being able to seize it with one hand,
he tried to catch it with both. But scarcely had he reached
out with both hands when the cup dived like a fish, and
floated again on the surface.</p>

<p>“Hang it!” thought the king, “I can’t help myself with
the cup, I’ll manage without it.” He then bent down to
the water, which was as clear as crystal and as cold as ice,
and began in his thirst to drink. Meanwhile his long beard,
which reached down to his girdle, dipped into the water.
When he had quenched his thirst and wished to get up
again, something was holding his beard and would not let
it go. He pulled once and again, but it was of no use; he
cried out therefore in anger, “Who’s there? Let go!”</p>

<p>“It’s I, the subterranean king, immortal Bony, and I
shall not let go till you give me that which you left unknowingly
at home, and which you do not expect to find on your
return.”</p>

<p>The king looked into the depth of the well, and there was
a huge head like a tub, with green eyes and a mouth from
ear to ear; the creature was holding the king by the beard
with extended claws like those of a crab, and was laughing
mischievously.</p>

<p>The king thought that a thing of which he had not known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
before starting, and which he did not expect on his return,
could not be of great value; so he said to the apparition,
“I give it.”</p>

<p>The apparition burst with laughter and vanished with a
flash of fire, and with it vanished also the well, the water,
the wooden fence, and the cup; and the king was again on
a hillock by a little wood kneeling on dry sand, and there
was nothing more. The king got up, crossed himself, sprang
on his horse, hastened to his attendants, and rode on.</p>

<p>In a week or maybe a fortnight the king arrived at his
capital; the people came out in crowds to meet him; he
went in procession to the great court of the palace and entered
the corridor. In the corridor stood the queen awaiting him,
and holding close to her bosom a cushion, on which lay a
child, beautiful as the moon, kicking in swaddling clothes.
The king recollected himself, sighed painfully, and said within
himself: “This is what I left without knowing and found
without expecting!” And bitterly, bitterly did he weep.
All marveled, but nobody dared to ask the cause. The
king, without saying a word, took his son in his arms, gazed
long on his innocent face, carried him into the palace himself,
laid him in the cradle, and, suppressing his sorrow, devoted
himself to the government of his realm; but he was never
again cheerful as formerly, since he was perpetually tormented
by the thought that some day Bony would claim his
son.</p>

<p>Meanwhile weeks, months, and years flowed on, and no
one came for his son. The prince, named “Unexpected,”
grew and developed, and eventually became a handsome
youth. The king also in course of time regained his usual
cheerfulness, and forgot what had taken place; but alas!
everybody did not forget so easily.</p>

<p>Once the prince, while hunting in a forest, became separated
from his suite and found himself in a savage wilderness.
Suddenly there appeared before him a hideous old man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
green eyes, who said, “How do you do, Prince Unexpected?
You have made me wait for you a long time.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“That you will find out hereafter, but now, when you
return to your father, greet him from me, and tell him that
I should be glad if he would close accounts with me, for if
he doesn’t soon get out of my debt of himself, he will repent
it bitterly.” After saying this the hideous old man disappeared,
and the prince in amazement turned his horse,
rode home, and told the king his adventure.</p>

<p>The king turned as pale as a sheet, and revealed the
frightful secret to his son. “Do not weep, father!” replied
the prince, “it is no great misfortune! I shall manage to
force Bony to renounce the right over me, which he tricked
you out of in so underhand a manner, but if in the course
of a year I do not return, it will be a token that we shall see
each other no more.”</p>

<p>The prince prepared for his journey; the king gave him a
suit of steel armor, a sword, and a horse, and the queen hung
round his neck a cross of pure gold. At leave-taking they embraced
affectionately, wept heartily, and the prince rode off.</p>

<p>On he rode one day, two days, three days, and at the
end of the fourth day at the setting of the sun he came to
the shore of the sea; and in the selfsame bay he espied
twelve dresses, white as snow, though in the water, as far
as the eye could reach, there was no living soul to be seen—only
twelve white geese were swimming at a distance from
the shore. Curious to know to whom they belonged, he
took one of the dresses, let his horse loose in a meadow,
concealed himself in a neighboring thicket, and waited to
see what would come to pass. Thereupon the geese, after
disporting themselves on the sea, swam to the shore. Eleven
of them went to the dresses, each threw herself on the
ground and became a beautiful damsel, dressed herself with
speed, and flew away into the plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The twelfth goose, the last and prettiest of all, did not
venture to come out on the shore, but only wistfully stretched
out her neck, looking on all sides. On seeing the prince she
called out with a human voice: “Prince Unexpected, give
me my dress; I will be grateful to you in return.” The
prince hearkened to her, placed the dress on the grass, and
modestly turned away in another direction.</p>

<p>The goose came out on the grass, changed herself into a
damsel, dressed herself hastily, and stood before the prince;
she was young and more beautiful than eye had seen or
ear heard of. Blushing, she gave him her white hand, and,
casting her eyes down, said with a pleasing voice: “I thank
you, good prince, for hearkening to me. I am the youngest
daughter of immortal Bony. He has twelve young daughters,
and rules in the subterranean realm. My father,
prince, has long been expecting you and is very angry.
However, don’t grieve, and don’t be frightened, but do as
I tell you. As soon as you see King Bony, fall at once on
your knees, and paying no regard to his outcry, upbraiding,
and threats, approach him boldly. What will happen afterwards
you will learn, but now we must part.”</p>

<p>On saying this the princess stamped on the ground with
her little foot; the ground sprang open at once, and they
descended into the subterranean realm, right into Bony’s
palace, which shone all underground brighter than our sun.
The prince stepped boldly into the reception room. Bony
was sitting on a golden throne with a glittering crown on
his head; his eyes gleamed like two saucers of green glass
and his hands were like the nippers of a crab. As soon as
the prince espied him at a distance, he fell on his knees, and
Bony yelled so horribly that the vaults of the subterranean
dominion quaked; but the prince boldly moved on his knees
towards the throne, and when he was only a few paces from
it, the king smiled and said: “Thou hast marvelous luck
in succeeding in making me smile; remain in our subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
realm, but before thou becomest a true citizen thereof
thou art bound to execute three commands of mine; but
because it is late today, we will begin tomorrow; meanwhile
go to thy room.”</p>

<p>The prince slept comfortably in the room assigned to him,
and early on the morrow Bony summoned him and said:
“We will see, prince, what thou canst do. In the course of
the following night build me a palace of pure marble; let
the windows be of crystal, the roof of gold, an elegant garden
round about it, and in the garden seats and fountains; if
thou buildest it, thou wilt gain thyself my love; if not, I
shall command thy head to be cut off.”</p>

<p>The prince heard the command, returned to his apartment,
and was sitting mournfully thinking of the death
that threatened him, when outside at the window a bee
came buzzing and said, “Let me in!” He opened the
lattice, in flew the bee, and the princess, Bony’s youngest
daughter, appeared before the wondering prince.</p>

<p>“What are you thus thinking about, Prince Unexpected?”</p>

<p>“Alas! I am thinking that your father wishes to deprive
me of life.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid! Lie down to sleep, and when you get
up tomorrow morning your palace will be ready.”</p>

<p>So, too, it came to pass. At dawn the prince came out
of his room and espied a more beautiful palace than he had
ever seen, and Bony, when he saw it, wondered, and would
not believe his own eyes.</p>

<p>“Well! thou hast won this time, and now thou hast my
second command. I shall place my twelve daughters before
thee tomorrow; if thou dost not guess which of them is
the youngest, thou wilt place thy head beneath the ax.”</p>

<p>“I unable to recognize the youngest princess!” said the
prince in his room. “What difficulty can there be in that?”</p>

<p>“This,” answered the princess, flying into the room in
the shape of a bee, “that if I don’t help you, you won’t recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
me, for we are all so alike that even our father distinguishes
us only by our dress.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do?”</p>

<p>“What, indeed! That will be the youngest over whose
right eye you espy a ladycow. Only look well. Adieu!”</p>

<p>On the morrow King Bony again summoned Prince Unexpected.
The princesses stood in a row side by side, all
dressed alike and with eyes cast down. The prince looked
and marveled how alike all the princesses were; he went
past them once, twice—he did not find the appointed
token; the third time he saw a ladycow over the eyebrow
of one, and cried out: “This is the youngest princess!”</p>

<p>“How the deuce have you guessed it?” said Bony angrily.
“There must be some trickery here. I must deal with your
lordship differently. In three hours you will come here
again, and will show your cleverness in my presence. I
shall light a straw, and you will stitch a pair of boots before
it goes out, and if you don’t do it you will perish.”</p>

<p>The prince returned desponding and found the bee already
in his apartment. “Why pensive again, prince?”</p>

<p>“How shouldn’t I be pensive, when your father wants
me to stitch him a pair of boots, for what sort of cobbler
am I?”</p>

<p>“What else will you do?”</p>

<p>“What am I to do? I shan’t stitch the boots, and I’m
not afraid of death—one can die but once!”</p>

<p>“No, prince, you shall not die! I will endeavor to rescue
you, and we will either escape together or perish together!
We must flee—there’s nothing else to be done.”</p>

<p>Saying this, the princess spat on one of the window
panes, and the spittle immediately froze. She then went
out of the room with the prince, locked the door after her,
and threw the key far away. Then, taking each other by
the hands, they ascended rapidly, and in a moment found
themselves on the very spot whence they had descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
into the subterranean realm; there was the selfsame sea,
the selfsame fresh meadow, and in the meadow cantered
the prince’s well-fed horse, who, as soon as he descried his
rider, came galloping straight to him. The prince didn’t
stop long to think, but sprang on his horse, the princess
seated herself behind him, and off they set as swift as an arrow.</p>

<p>King Bony at the appointed hour did not wait for Prince
Unexpected, but sent to ask him why he did not appear.
Finding the door locked, the servants knocked at it vigorously,
and the spittle answered them from the middle of
the room in the prince’s voice, “Anon.” The servants
carried this answer to the king; he waited, waited, no
prince; he therefore again sent the same servants, who
heard the same answer: “Anon!” and carried what they
had heard to the king.</p>

<p>“What’s this? Does he mean to make fun of me?”
shouted the king in wrath. “Go at once, break the door
open, and conduct him to me!”</p>

<p>The servants hurried off, broke open the door, and rushed
in. What, indeed? There was nobody there, and the
spittle on the pane of glass was splitting with laughter at
them. Bony all but burst with rage, and ordered them all
to start off in pursuit of the prince, threatening them with
death if they returned empty-handed. They sprang on
horseback and hastened away after the prince and princess.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prince Unexpected and the princess, Bony’s
daughter, were hurrying away on their spirited horse, and
amidst their rapid flight heard “Tramp, tramp,” behind
them. The prince sprang from the horse, put his ear to
the ground, and said, “They are pursuing us.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the princess, “we have no time to lose.”
Instantly she transformed herself into a river, changed the
prince into a bridge and the horse into a raven, and divided
the grand highway beyond the bridge into three roads.
Swiftly on the fresh track hastened the pursuers, came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the bridge, and stood stupefied; they saw the track up to
the bridge, but beyond it disappeared, and the highway
divided into three roads. There was nothing to be done
but to return, and they came with naught. Bony shouted
with rage, and cried out: “A bridge and a river! It was
they. How was it that ye did not guess it? Back, and
don’t return without them!” The pursuers recommenced
the pursuit.</p>

<p>“I hear ‘Tramp, tramp!’” whispered the princess,
Bony’s daughter, affrightedly to Prince Unexpected, who
sprang from the saddle, put his ear to the ground, and replied:
“They are making haste, and are not far off.”</p>

<p>That instant the princess and prince, and with them also
their horse, became a gloomy forest, in which there were
roads, byroads, and footpaths without number, and on one
of them it seemed that two riders were hastening on a horse.
Following the fresh track, the pursuers came up to the
forest, and when they espied the fugitives in it, they hastened
speedily after them. On and on hurried the pursuers, seeing
continually before them a thick forest, a wide road, and
the fugitives on it; now, now they thought to overtake
them, when the fugitives and the thick forest suddenly
vanished, and they found themselves at the selfsame place
whence they had started in pursuit. They returned, therefore,
again to Bony empty-handed.</p>

<p>“A horse, a horse! I’ll go myself! they won’t escape
out of my hands!” yelled Bony, foaming at the mouth,
and started in pursuit.</p>

<p>Again the princess said to Prince Unexpected: “Methinks
they are pursuing us, and this time it is Bony, my
father, himself, but the first church is the boundary of his
dominion, and he cannot pursue us farther. Give me your
golden cross.”</p>

<p>The prince took off his affectionate mother’s gift and gave
it to the princess, and in a moment she was transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
into a church, he into the priest, and the horse into the
bell; and that instant up came Bony.</p>

<p>“Monk!” Bony asked the priest, “hast thou not seen
some travelers on horseback?”</p>

<p>“Only just now Prince Unexpected rode this way with
the princess, Bony’s daughter. They came into the church,
performed their devotions, gave money for a mass for your
good health, and ordered me to present their respects to
you if you should ride this way.”</p>

<p>Bony, too, returned empty-handed. But Prince Unexpected
rode on with the princess, Bony’s daughter, in no
further fear of pursuit.</p>

<p>They rode gently on, when they saw before them a beautiful
town, into which the prince felt an irresistible longing
to go.</p>

<p>“Prince,” said the princess, “don’t go; my heart forebodes
misfortune there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ride there for only a short time, and look round the
town, and we’ll then proceed on our journey.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to ride thither, but will it be as easy
to return? Nevertheless, as you absolutely desire it, go,
and I will remain here in the form of a white stone till you
return; be circumspect, my beloved; the king, the queen,
and the princess, their daughter, will come out to meet you,
and with them will be a beautiful little boy—don’t kiss
him, for, if you do, you will forget me at once, and will
never set eyes on me more in the world—I shall die of
despair. I will wait for you here on the road for three
days, and if on the third day you don’t return, remember
that I perish, and perish all through you.” The prince
took leave and rode to the town, and the princess transformed
herself into a white stone and remained on the road.</p>

<p>One day passed, a second passed, the third also passed, and
nothing was seen of the prince. Poor princess! He had
not obeyed her counsel; in the town, the king, the queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and the princess their daughter had come out to meet him,
and with them walked a little boy, a curly-headed chatterbox,
with eyes as bright as stars. The child rushed straight
into the prince’s arms, who was so captivated by the beauty
of the lad that he forgot everything and kissed the child
affectionately. That moment his memory was darkened,
and he utterly forgot the princess, Bony’s daughter.</p>

<p>The princess lay as a white stone by the wayside, one
day, two days, and when the third day passed and the
prince did not return from the town, she transformed herself
into a cornflower, and sprang in among the rye by the
roadside. “Here I shall stay by the roadside; maybe some
passer-by will pull me up or trample me into the ground,”
said she, and tears like dewdrops glittered on the azure petals.</p>

<p>Just then an old man came along the road, espied the cornflower
in the rye by the wayside, was captivated by its
beauty, extracted it carefully from the ground, carried it
into his dwelling, set it in a flowerpot, watered it, and began
to tend it attentively. But—O marvel!—ever since the
time that the cornflower was brought into his dwelling, all
kinds of wonders began to happen in it. Scarcely was the
old man awake, when everything in the house was already
set in order, nowhere was the least atom of dust remaining.
At noon he came home—dinner was all ready, the table set;
he had but to sit down and eat as much as he wanted. The
old man wondered and wondered, till at last terror took
possession of him, and he betook himself for advice to an
old witch of his acquaintance in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Do this,” the witch advised him: “get up before the
first morning dawn, before the cocks crow to announce
daylight, and notice diligently what begins to stir first in
the house, and that which does stir, cover with this napkin:
what will happen further, you will see.”</p>

<p>The old man did not close his eyes the whole night, and
as soon as the first gleam appeared and things began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
visible in the house, he saw how the cornflower suddenly
moved in the flowerpot, sprang out, and began to stir about
the room; when simultaneously everything began to put
itself in its place; the dust began to sweep itself clean away,
and the fire kindled itself in the stove. The old man sprang
cleverly out of his bed and placed the cloth on the flower as
it endeavored to escape, when lo! the flower became a
beautiful damsel—the princess, Bony’s daughter.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” cried the princess. “Why
have you brought life back to me? My betrothed, Prince
Unexpected, has forgotten me, and therefore life has become
distasteful to me.”</p>

<p>“Your betrothed, Prince Unexpected, is going to be married
today; the wedding feast is ready, and the guests are beginning
to assemble.”</p>

<p>The princess wept, but after a while dried her tears,
dressed herself in frieze, and went into the town like a
village girl. She came to the royal kitchen, where there
was great noise and bustle. She went up to the clerk of
the kitchen with humble and attractive grace, and said in a
sweet voice: “Dear sir, do me one favor: allow me to
make a wedding cake for Prince Unexpected.”</p>

<p>Occupied with work, the first impulse of the clerk of the
kitchen was to give the girl a rebuff; but when he looked
at her, the words died on his lips and he answered kindly:
“Ah, my beauty of beauties! do what you will; I will
hand the prince your cake myself.”</p>

<p>The cake was soon baked, and all the invited guests,
were sitting at table. The clerk of the kitchen himself
placed a huge cake on a silver dish before the prince; but
scarce had the prince made a cut in the side of it, when lo!
an unheard-of marvel displayed itself in the presence of all.
A gray tom-pigeon and a white hen-pigeon came out of the
cake; the tom-pigeon walked along the table, and the hen-pigeon
walked after him, cooing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Stay, stay, my pigeonet, oh stay!</div>
<div class="verse">Don’t from thy true love flee away;</div>
<div class="verse">My faithless lover I pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">Prince Unexpected like unto,</div>
<div class="verse">Who Bony’s daughter did betray.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Scarcely had Prince Unexpected heard this cooing of the
pigeon, when he regained his lost recollection, bounced from
the table, rushed to the door, and behind the door the
princess, Bony’s daughter, took him by the hand; they
went together down the corridor, and before them stood a
horse saddled and bridled.</p>

<p>Why delay? Prince Unexpected and the princess, Bony’s
daughter, sprang on the horse, started on the road, and at
last arrived happily in the realm of Prince Unexpected’s
father. The king and the queen received them with joy
and merriment, and did not wait long before they prepared
them a magnificent wedding, the like of which eye never saw
and ear never heard of.</p>

<h4>THE GREEDY COBBLER</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Welsh Folk Tale—Ethics, teaching contentment</i>)</p>

<p>Once upon a time a Welsh cobbler carrying a hazel wand
was walking over London Bridge, and as he sauntered along
he met an Englishman.</p>

<p>“Ah,” the latter exclaimed, pointing to the wand the
man of Cambria used as a cane, “where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Where did I get it?” the Welshman repeated, amazed
that any one should ask such a question. “Off of a hazel
bush, to be sure.”</p>

<p>But the stranger stared in big-eyed wonder and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“There is only one hazel bush of that kind in all the
world,” he declared, “and under it a vast treasure is hidden.
Lead me to the spot, and I will share it with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The Welshman smiled pleasantly, for he began to have
visions of a luxurious, idle life. He hated to work, and was
always grumbling because he had to hammer away at shoe
lasts to make his living.</p>

<p>To be sure he would lead the Englishman to the spot, and
once he had some gold in his possession, he’d do nothing but
feast and ride in a coach and dance at the fair. So he said
quite wearily, lest the stranger think he seemed too eager
and change his mind, “It is a long way from here, in the
Vale of Neath in my native Wales, and by my faith I have
no desire to walk that distance.”</p>

<p>But the Englishman coaxed, which was just what the
Welshman wanted him to do. So they turned away from
London Bridge and journeyed northward across mountains
and valleys, until they came to Cambria.</p>

<p>After several days they came to Craig-i-Ddinas, in the
lovely Vale of Neath. The Welshman led the way to the
hazel bush, beside which he had often played when a boy,
and the Englishman said, “In due time we will begin
work.”</p>

<p>When darkness was heavy enough to cover all trace of
what they did, they dug up the bush, and the Englishman,
who happened to be a wizard, pointed to a broad stone under
the roots and said, “Below is the treasure. Do as I bid
and you shall be rich.”</p>

<p>And the Welshman began to feel very important, thinking
how people would honor him when he lived in a great house
and wore a velvet coat.</p>

<p>Then the cock crowed for dawn, and they knew they must
hurry away before any of the peasants saw them. The
Welshman did not wish his village cousins to know he was
there, for they would question why he had come; so they
found a vacant tinker’s hut in which to rest until darkness
made it safe for them to go to work again.</p>

<p>But the cobbler was too excited to sleep. The sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the broad, flat stone at the root of the hazel bush brought
back to his mind a story he had often heard, one that the
village grandmothers used to tell when he was a boy. Again
and again he thought of it, the story of the treasure of King
Arthur.</p>

<p>Historians state that when the ruler of Camelot was
killed in the battle of Mount Badon, he was buried at
Glastonbury, but the Welsh country folk say that is not
true. They declare Merlin carried him straight to the lovely
Vale of Neath, where he sleeps on his arms, with his Round
Table Knights beside him and all the wealth of his realm
piled at his feet. There he and his warriors will rest until
the ringing of a warning bell, when the Black and Golden
Eagles go to war. Then they will rise up and destroy every
enemy of Cambria, when Britain will be governed with
justice and peace will reign as long as the world endures.
Could it be that the broad stone at the foot of the hazel
tree covered the entrance to Arthur’s cave? This the
Welshman pondered until it was almost dark and time to
go to work again.</p>

<p>Cautiously they left the hut and approached the spot,
peering in every direction lest some one see and question
them. Sturdily they pulled and tugged at the rock, and
slowly, steadily moved it, until they found an opening like
a door. Then the Englishman said in a low tone, “Behold
King Arthur’s cave! Follow me and obey.”</p>

<p>The Welshman followed, and a wonderful sight met his
eyes. Thousands of warriors slept in a circle on their arms,
and in the midst of them, more splendid looking than any
other, lay the King of Camelot, the mighty Arthur himself.
His crown of gold was by his side, a pile of gold lay at his
feet, and beyond the circle of his followers were a thousand
steeds, all saddled and bridled as if ready for battle. Sometimes
they champed as if eager for the war cry, sometimes
they drooped their heads wearily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Noticing a bell suspended just above the treasure heap,
the cobbler pointed to it.</p>

<p>“Do not touch it,” the Englishman warned. “But if by
accident you do, and the warriors waken and ask if it is day,
say, ‘No, sleep thou on.’ Otherwise a terrible fate will
overtake you.”</p>

<p>They helped themselves to the gold and left the cave,
and each man went his way. The Welshman, having all
the treasure he could carry, was no longer a poor cobbler
who must spend his time bending over shoe lasts. He was
richer than the mayor and could feast and ride in a coach,
dance at the fair, and live like the lords of the land.</p>

<p>But riches made that cobbler greedy. He had far more
gold than he needed, and the finest house in seven counties,
but still he wanted more. He kept thinking of the gold
piled high in Arthur’s cave; so one day he journeyed back
to the Vale of Neath and waited for nightfall.</p>

<p>Then, creeping to the place of the hazel bush, he moved
the rock and went into the cave.</p>

<p>Ah, it was a goodly sight, those thousand warriors slumbering
there beside the treasure heap and a thousand saddled
chargers beyond! He would take all the gold he could
carry, and very soon he would come back for more. But
in his greed to increase his wealth he bumped against the
bell, which clanged loudly. The warriors started up, asking
if it was day, but the man was so dazzled by the pile of
shining treasure that he did not have the answer ready.
They leaped to their feet, called him a robber, beat him, and
drove him from the cave.</p>

<p>Then what a change! He went limping homeward, to
discover that all his wealth had disappeared and where his
great house had stood was a miserable hut. He was as poor
as ever, and unless he could get more gold out of the cave
must go back to cobbling and never again ride in a coach.
But try as he would, he could not find the place where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
hazel bush had grown. Many a journey he made into the
Vale of Neath, but never did he catch a glimpse of the broad,
flat stone. He had to spend his days bending over shoe
lasts instead of riding in a coach, and was a cripple as long
as he lived.</p>

<h4>THE STORY OF A SALMON</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By David Starr Jordan</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Science</i>)</p>

<p>In the realm of the Northwest Wind, on the boundary
line between the dark fir forests and the sunny plains, there
stands a mountain—a great white cone two miles and a
half in perpendicular height. On its lower mile the dense
fir woods cover it with never changing green; on its next
half mile a lighter green of grass and bushes gives place in
winter to white; and on its uppermost mile the snows of
the great ice age still linger in unspotted purity. The
people of Washington Territory say that their mountain
is the great “King-pin of the Universe,” which shows that
even in its own country Mount Tacoma is not without
honor.</p>

<p>Flowing down from the southwest slope of Mount Tacoma
is a cold, clear river, fed by the melting snows of the mountain.
Madly it hastens down over white cascades and
beds of shining sands, through birch woods and belts of
dark firs, to mingle its waters at last with those of the great
Columbia. This river is the Cowlitz; and on its bottom,
not many years ago, there lay half buried in the sand a
number of little orange-colored globules, each about as large
as a pea. These were not much in themselves, but great
in their possibilities. In the waters above them little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
suckers and chubs and prickly sculpins strained their mouths
to draw these globules from the sand, and vicious-looking
crawfishes picked them up with their blundering hands and
examined them with their telescopic eyes. But one, at least,
of the globules escaped their curiosity, else this story would
not be worth telling. The sun shone down on it through
the clear water, and the ripples of the Cowlitz said over it
their incantations, and in it at last awoke a living being.
It was a fish,—a curious little fellow, not half an inch long,
with great, staring eyes, which made almost half his length,
and with a body so transparent that he could not cast a
shadow. He was a little salmon, a very little salmon;
but the water was good, and there were flies and worms and
little living creatures in abundance for him to eat, and he
soon became a larger salmon. Then there were many more
little salmon with him, some larger and some smaller,
and they all had a merry time. Those who had been born
soonest and had grown largest used to chase the others around
and bite heads and swallow them whole; for, said they,
“even young salmon are good eating.” “Heads I win, tails
you lose,” was their motto. Thus, what was once two
small salmon became united into a single larger one, and
the process of “addition, division, and silence” still went on.</p>

<p>By and by, when all the salmon were too large to be
swallowed, they began to grow restless. They saw that
the water rushing by seemed to be in a great hurry to get
somewhere, and it was somehow suggested that its hurry
was caused by something good to eat at the other end of its
course. Then they all started down the stream, salmon
fashion,—which fashion is to get into the current, head
upstream, and thus to drift backward as the river sweeps
along.</p>

<p>At last they came to where the Cowlitz and the Columbia
join, and they were almost lost for a time; for they could
find no shores, and the bottom and the top of the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
were so far apart. Here they saw other and far larger salmon
in the deepest part of the current, turning neither to the
right nor to the left, but swimming right on upstream just
as rapidly as they could. And these great salmon would
not stop for them, and would not lie and float with the current.
They had no time to talk, even in the simple sign
language by which fishes express their ideas, and no time
to eat. They had important work before them, and the
time was short. So they went on up the river, keeping their
great purposes to themselves; and our little salmon and his
friends from the Cowlitz drifted down the stream.</p>

<p>By and by the water began to change. It grew denser,
and no longer flowed rapidly along; and twice a day it
used to turn about and flow the other way. Then the shores
disappeared, and the water began to have a different and
peculiar flavor,—a flavor which seemed to the salmon
much richer and more inspiring than the glacier water of
their native Cowlitz. There were many curious things to
see—crabs with hard shells and savage faces, but so good
when crushed and swallowed! Then there were luscious
squid swimming about; and, to a salmon, squid are like
ripe peaches and cream. There were great companies of
delicate sardines and herring, green and silvery, and it was
such fun to chase and capture them! Those who eat
sardines packed in oil by greasy fingers, and herrings dried
in the smoke, can have little idea how satisfying it is to
have a meal of them, plump and sleek and silvery, fresh from
the sea.</p>

<p>Thus the salmon chased the herrings about, and had a
merry time. Then they were chased in turn by great sea
lions,—swimming monsters with huge half-human faces,
long thin whiskers, and blundering ways. The sea lions like
to bite out the throat of a salmon, with its precious stomach
full of luscious sardines, and then to leave the rest of the fish
to shift for itself. And the seals and the herrings scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the salmon about, till at last the hero of our story found
himself quite alone, with none of his own kind near him.
But that did not trouble him much, and he went on his
own way, getting his dinner when he was hungry, which was
all the time, and then eating a little between meals for his
stomach’s sake.</p>

<p>So it went on for three long years; and at the end of this
time our little fish had grown to be a great, fine salmon of
twenty-two pounds’ weight, shining like a new tin pan, and
with rows of the loveliest round black spots on his head and
back and tail. One day, as he was swimming about, idly
chasing a big sculpin with a head so thorny that he never
was swallowed by anybody, all of a sudden the salmon
noticed a change in the water around him.</p>

<p>Spring had come again, and the south-lying snowdrifts
on the Cascade Mountains once more felt that the “earth
was wheeling sunwards.” The cold snow waters ran down
from the mountains and into the Columbia River, and made
a freshet on the river. The high water went far out into the
sea, and out in the sea our salmon felt it on his gills. He
remembered how the cold water used to feel in the Cowlitz
when he was a little fish. In a blundering, fishy fashion
he thought about it; he wondered whether the little eddy
looked as it used to look and whether caddis worms and
young mosquitoes were really as sweet and tender as he
used to think they were. Then he thought some other
things; but as the salmon’s mind is located in the optic
lobes of his brain, and ours is in a different place, we cannot
be quite certain what his thoughts really were.</p>

<p>What our salmon did, we know. He did what every
grown salmon in the ocean does when he feels the glacier
water once more upon his gills. He became a changed being.
He spurned the blandishment of soft-shelled crabs. The
pleasures of the table and of the chase, heretofore his only
delights, lost their charms for him. He turned his course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
straight toward the direction whence the cold water came,
and for the rest of his life never tasted a mouthful of food.
He moved on toward the river mouth, at first playfully, as
though he were not really certain whether he meant anything
after all. Afterward, when he struck the full current
of the Columbia, he plunged straight forward with an unflinching
determination that had in it something of the heroic.
When he had passed the rough water at the bar, he was not
alone. His old neighbors of the Cowlitz, and many more
from the Clackamas and the Spokane and Des Chutes and
Kootanie,—a great army of salmon,—were with him.
In front were thousands pressing on, and behind them were
thousands more, all moved by a common impulse which
urged them up the Columbia.</p>

<p>They were all swimming bravely along where the current
was deepest, when suddenly the foremost felt something
tickling like a cobweb about their noses and under their
chins. They changed their course a little to brush it off
and it touched their fins as well. Then they tried to slip
down with the current, and thus leave it behind. But, no!
the thing, whatever it was, although its touch was soft,
refused to let go, and held them like a fetter. The more
they struggled, the tighter became its grasp, and the whole
foremost rank of the salmon felt it together; for it was a
great gill net, a quarter of a mile long, stretched squarely
across the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>By and by men came in boats, and hauled up the gill
net and the helpless salmon that had become entangled in
it. They threw the fishes into a pile in the bottom of the
boat, and the others saw them no more. We that live outside
the water know better what befalls them, and we can
tell the story which the salmon could not.</p>

<p>All along the banks of the Columbia River, from its mouth
to nearly thirty miles away, there is a succession of large
buildings, looking like great barns or warehouses, built on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
piles in the river, high enough to be out of the reach of
floods. There are thirty of these buildings, and they are
called “canneries.” Each cannery has about forty boats,
and with each boat are two men and a long gill net. These
nets fill the whole river as with a nest of cobwebs from
April to July, and to each cannery nearly a thousand great
salmon are brought every day. These salmon are thrown
in a pile on the floor; and Wing Hop, the big Chinaman,
takes them one after another on the table, and with a great
knife dexterously cuts off the head, the tail, and the fins;
then with a sudden thrust he removes the intestines and the
eggs. The body goes into a tank of water; and the head is
dropped into a box on a flatboat, and goes down the river
to be made into salmon oil. Next the body is brought to
another table; and Quong Sang, with a machine like a
feed cutter, cuts it into pieces each just as long as a one-pound
can. Then Ah Sam, with a butcher knife, cuts
these pieces into strips just as wide as the can. Next Wan
Lee, the “China boy,” brings down a hundred cans from the
loft where the tinners are making them, and into each can
puts a spoonful of salt. It takes just six salmon to fill a
hundred cans. Then twenty Chinamen put the pieces of
meat into the cans, fitting in little strips to make them
exactly full. Ten more solder up the cans, and ten more
put the cans into boiling water till the meat is thoroughly
cooked, and five more punch a little hole in the head of each
can to let out the air. Then they solder them up again,
and little girls paste on them bright-colored labels showing
merry little cupids riding the happy salmon up to the cannery
door, with Mount Tacoma and Cape Disappointment
in the background; and a legend underneath says that this is
“Booth’s” or “Badollet’s Best,” or “Hume’s,” or “Clark’s,”
or “Kinney’s Superfine Salt Water Salmon.” Then the
cans are placed in cases, forty-eight in a case, and five
hundred thousand cases are put up every year. Great ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
come to Astoria, and are loaded with them; and they carry
them away to London and San Francisco and Liverpool
and New York and Sydney and Valparaiso; and the man
at the corner grocery sells them at twenty cents a can.</p>

<p>All this time our salmon is going up the river, eluding
one net as by a miracle, and soon having need of more
miracles to escape the rest; passing by Astoria on a fortunate
day,—which was Sunday, the day on which no
man may fish if he expects to sell what he catches,—till
finally he came to where nets were few, and, at last, to
where they ceased altogether. But there he found that
scarcely any of his companions were with him; for the nets
cease when there are no more salmon to be caught in them.
So he went on, day and night, where the water was deepest,
stopping not to feed or loiter on the way, till at last he came
to a wild gorge, where the great river became an angry torrent,
rushing wildly over a huge staircase of rocks. But
our hero did not falter; and summoning all his forces, he
plunged into the Cascades. The current caught him and
dashed him against the rocks. A whole row of silvery scales
came off and glistened in the water like sparks of fire, and
a place on his side became black and red, which for a salmon
is the same as being black and blue for other people. His
comrades tried to go up with him; and one lost his eye,
one his tail, and one had his lower jaw pushed back into
his head like the joint of a telescope. Again he tried to
surmount the Cascades; and at last he succeeded, and an
Indian on the rocks above was waiting to receive him.
But the Indian with his spear was less skillful than he was
wont to be, and our hero escaped, losing only a part of one
of his fins; and with him came one other, and henceforth
these two pursued their journey together.</p>

<p>Now a gradual change took place in the looks of our
salmon. In the sea he was plump and round and silvery,
with delicate teeth in a symmetrical mouth. Now his silvery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
color disappeared, his skin grew slimy, and the scales sank
into it: his back grew black, and his sides turned red,—not
a healthy red, but a sort of hectic flush. He grew poor;
and his back, formerly as straight as need be, now developed
an unpleasant hump at the shoulders. His eyes—like
those of all enthusiasts who forsake eating and sleeping for
some loftier aim—became dark and sunken. His symmetrical
jaws grew longer and longer, and projected from
his mouth, giving him a savage and wolfish appearance,
quite at variance with his real disposition. For all the desires
and ambitions of his nature had become centered into
one. We may not know what this one was, but we know
that it was a strong one; for it had led him on and on,—past
the nets and horrors of Astoria; past the dangerous
Cascades, past the spears of Indians; through the terrible
flume of the Dalles, where the mighty river is compressed
between huge rocks into a channel narrower than a village
street; on past the meadows of Umatilla and the wheat
fields of Walla Walla; on to where the great Snake River
and the Columbia join; on up the Snake River and its
eastern branch, till at last he reached the foot of the Bitter
Root Mountains in the Territory of Idaho, nearly a thousand
miles from the ocean which he had left in April. With him
still was the other salmon which had come with him through
the Cascades, handsomer and smaller than he, and, like
him, growing poor and ragged and tired.</p>

<p>At last, one October afternoon, our finny travelers came
together to a little clear brook, with a bottom of fine gravel,
over which the water was but a few inches deep. Our fish
painfully worked his way to it; for his tail was all frayed
out, his muscles were sore, and his skin covered with unsightly
blotches. But his sunken eyes saw a ripple in the
stream, and under it a bed of little pebbles and sand. So
there in the sand he scooped out with his tail a smooth round
place, and his companion came and filled it with orange-colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
eggs. Then our salmon came back again; and
softly covering the eggs, the work of their lives was done,
and, in the old salmon fashion, they drifted tail foremost
down the stream.</p>

<p>They drifted on together for a night and a day, but they
never came to the sea. For the salmon has but one life to
live, and it ascends the river but once. The rest lies with
its children. And when the April sunshine fell on the
globules in the gravel, these were awakened into life. With
the early autumn rains, the little fishes were large enough
to begin their wanderings. They dropped down the current
in the old salmon fashion. And thus they came into the
great river and drifted away to the sea.</p>

<h4>THE PIGEONS OF VENICE</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>History</i>)</p>

<p>In one of the upland valleys of Italy, shut away from the
rest of the world by the high, white peaks men call the
Dolomites, there lived, about five hundred years ago, a little
boy named Leonardo. He dwelt in a tiny hut with his
black-eyed peasant mother, fed the pigeons and milked the
goats each day, and in the evening, the pleasant summer
evening that spread rainbow-colored draperies over the
Dolomite peaks, he lay in the shadows under the plum
tree, thinking about his brother Vittorio, who was a soldier
down in the great city of Venice.</p>

<p>“I wish brother would come home,” he said to his mother
one morning as they ate their breakfast of macaroni and
mountain bread, “because he always tells such wonderful
things about the city. Some day I mean to go there and be
a soldier, too.”</p>

<p>His dark eyes gleamed as he spoke, and he sat very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
straight in his heavy oaken chair, as of course a soldier ought
to do.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that wishes do not always come true,
but sometimes they do, and when that happens the whole
world seems brighter and lovelier than it seemed before.
The next afternoon, as Leonardo was turning the goats into
their inclosure, he gave a shout so joyous that even Armando
the weaver, in his shop at the other end of the village, heard
and ran to see what it meant. He soon found out, for he
saw Leonardo hurrying toward a man who was moving
along the highway. Vittorio, the soldier brother, was coming
home, coming back to the mountain village with many a
tale of the splendid city beside the Adriatic, and perhaps
with a goody that would taste very sweet after the coarse
fare of weeks and months.</p>

<p>Far into the night the brothers sat and talked together,
talked of palaces and gliding gondolas, of great lords and
ladies, of soldiers moving in splendid uniforms about the
Piazza of St. Mark. They talked of Carnival time too, of
the merry pranks the people played on each other, of the
procession on the water and the presents given to the Doge.</p>

<p>“And sometimes,” Vittorio exclaimed proudly, “they
are very splendid. Sometimes they are of gold and silver,
and of silk stuffs brought from the Indies.”</p>

<p>Leonardo sat silent for a minute. He knew little of
present giving, for in the mountains where he lived there
was no money to spend on such things. But always when
he made his mother a garland of flowers on her birthday,
she seemed so happy about it that he thought it must be
very lovely to bestow gifts. So he said softly, “I should
like to send a present to the Doge. It would seem like doing
something for Venice. But I have nothing to give.”</p>

<p>“Wait until you are a man and can be a soldier,” the big
brother answered. “Then you will be doing much.”</p>

<p>The next morning he was up at daybreak. Vittorio had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
only two days’ leave, which meant that he must start back
at noon, and his mother had promised that Leonardo might
go with him to the edge of the village if he finished his tasks
in time. So he milked the goats before there was a bit of
stirring about the hut, and led the geese from their pen to
crop the green grass on the hillside. Then he cut some
grass and threw it to the old horse that was their most
prized possession, and by the time his brother came from the
hut he called to him, “I have only to feed the pigeons yet.”</p>

<p>Vittorio smiled and stood watching as the boy whistled
to the birds.</p>

<p>The gentle creatures flew up at Leonardo’s call, and as
he scattered crumbs to them, he thought again of the great
carnival at Venice and the gifts that would be made to the
Doge. He wished that he too might join that throng of
givers, but he possessed nothing but his pigeons, and a bird
would seem a very poor present to offer a ruler. But he
happened to think that the schoolmaster had once told him
that it is not the cost or the beauty of an offering that
makes it precious, but the good will of the giver, and that a
beggar’s portion may be a lovelier gift than that of a prince.
The schoolmaster was very wise. He could both read and
write, which only a few could do in that day, so anything
that he said must be true; and the memory of the words
brought an idea to Leonardo that made the boy’s eyes dance.</p>

<p>“Vittorio,” he exclaimed suddenly, “I have thought of
something.”</p>

<p>Vittorio wondered what excited his brother so.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked as he walked near.</p>

<p>“Will you take a pair of pigeons back to the city with
you?”</p>

<p>“A pair of pigeons,” the soldier repeated. “Why?”</p>

<p>“I want to send a present to the Doge, and I have nothing
else,” he answered. “But the birds are so gentle I am
sure he will like them. They are fine carriers, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Vittorio smiled. Being in the army of the Doge, he was
pleased that his brother showed such loyalty to the master
he served. It meant that he would probably grow up to
be a good soldier, and in those days nothing was considered
finer than that. So he answered pleasantly: “Of course I
will, Leonardo, if you are sure you can give up your pets.
I will ask my captain, who knows the Doge well, to take
them to him and say that they are the gift of a mountain
boy.”</p>

<p>Leonardo’s eyes sparkled with delight. It seemed a
glorious thing that he too might give with the rich and
great; so he selected the handsomest pair in the covey,
birds of a soft gray, with shadings of blue and purple along
their delicate wings, and he and Vittorio made a rude cage
in which to carry them to the city.</p>

<p>Then they walked together to the edge of the village, and
Leonardo watched his brother go along the road that wound
down to the low country. He waved good-by until Vittorio
passed from sight, then went back to the hut, happy in the
thought that he was doing something for Venice.</p>

<p>Many months passed. It was September when Vittorio
went away, and now the blossom time had come and hills
were bright with touches of summer. All through that
long period Leonardo wondered much about the pigeons,
but no word came from his brother; for letters went only
by courier in those days, and poor folk could not pay for
the carrying. But he was sure the birds had reached the
Doge, for Vittorio had promised and a soldier never broke
his word.</p>

<p>Then one day in the autumn, when the brightness on the
mountains had faded to bronze and gray, and squirrels
were stocking their houses as nuts dropped in the woods,
Vittorio came back. He looked older and graver than
the year before, and some worrying thing seemed on his
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is just to say good-by,” he said, as the gray-haired
mother stroked his hands and Leonardo looked at him
with loving eyes. “The war has begun, and we soldiers of
Venice must sail away to Candia for the fighting.”</p>

<p>Leonardo’s eyes grew wide, and tears came into them as
he exclaimed, “If only I were old enough to go with you
and help serve our glorious city of St. Mark!”</p>

<p>The big man laid his hand lovingly on the dark head.</p>

<p>“Never mind, brother,” he said. “You have already
done much. I gave your birds to my captain, who took
them to the Doge, and the Doge is proud of them because
they are splendid carriers. So Dandolo, our general, will
take them along with the army to bring back news of the
war. And now good-by. When the fighting is over, I
will come again.”</p>

<p>He mounted his horse and rode away, and two pairs of
dewy eyes looked after him as he went.</p>

<p>The days that followed seemed very long to the two who
waited in the highlands. They knew that the army had
gone, and that away on the eastern island perhaps the fighting
had begun. But what of the fate of the Venetian hosts,
and what of the son and brother who had sailed under the
standard of the Lion? As to that they could only hope
and wonder.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly dragged the days, but no word came back.</p>

<p>One morning, while Leonardo and his mother prayed
and waited in the mountain cabin, down in Venice in the
splendid Palace of the Doges, the Council of Ten sat and
pondered. They talked much about the absent army,
wondering if victory or defeat had been its share, and while
they wondered there came a fluttering of soft gray wings.</p>

<p>“Pigeons!” some one called. “See, they are carriers!”</p>

<p>The dignified assemblage broke up in excitement, for they
knew the tiny birds were messengers, and the men hurried
to read the missives fastened to their crimson feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“They come from Dandolo,” said one of the nobles,
“bringing news of the war.”</p>

<p>“From Candia!” another exclaimed. “It cannot be
that they have flown so far!”</p>

<p>But it was true, for upon reading they learned that the
Venetian army had been victorious and the soldiers would
soon sail home in triumph. The tiny birds had flown all
the long leagues across the sea to carry the glad news to
the waiting people.</p>

<p>Up in the hut in the Italian highlands Leonardo and his
mother still watched and wondered, when one evening a few
days later Armando, the village weaver, came by on his
way home from the city. He was greatly excited and called
to them as he stopped at the door.</p>

<p>“Rejoice,” he said, “for the war is over!”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” the mother asked. “Are the
soldiers back?”</p>

<p>“No. But the pigeons brought the word, and every one
is glad.”</p>

<p>“Pigeons!” exclaimed Leonardo. “My pigeons! Then
after all I did something for Venice.”</p>

<p>And he spoke the truth. So much did the message mean
to the anxious people, that the lawmakers said they would
always keep the birds, they and their young and their children’s
young. And although hundreds of years have
passed since then, still the gray-winged creatures fly about
St. Mark’s Square, and the people love and feed them.
For they know they are descended from the pair sent to
the Doge by a mountain boy, Leonardo’s pigeons, that long
ago flew across the wide seas, bringing word of the victory
of the Venetian hosts.</p>

<h4>THE COMING OF THE WONDER TREE</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from an Arabian Legend</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Geography—Nature Study</i>)</p>

<p>Abi Ben Ahmed was a chief of Araby, and there was no
sweeter child in the land than his little daughter Zuleika.
She was fair to look upon, with eyes slender as an almond
and soft as a gazelle’s, and the goodness of her heart was
known to every one in the tribe. Lowly slave and mighty
sheik alike loved her, and when she was with her father he
forgot all his trouble.</p>

<p>One evening when the sun was dropping low over the
desert, Zuleika sat in front of the tent waiting for a chance
to have her supper. Her father was eating just then, for
by the laws of Arabian politeness women and children must
wait for meals until their lords and masters have finished.
She was hungry, yet she did not mind the delay, because
she knew nothing else, and when you think all the world
does things as you do, your way does not seem hard. So
she watched the color flame across the western sky, hummed
snatches of song, and made pictures in the sand with her
fingers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, away to the south, a yellow cloud seemed to
rise out of the desert. It moved nearer, and as Zuleika
watched it her dark eyes began to sparkle. She knew what
it meant and it made her glad.</p>

<p>“Father,” she called, “some one is riding this way.”</p>

<p>Abi Ben Ahmed left his supper and came from the tent
to see. The Arab is fond of his food and very loth to leave
it, but when strangers almost never come by it is worth
going without a meal to see them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, as his piercing eyes scanned the southern
horizon, “some one is traveling across the desert.”</p>

<p>Zuleika danced with delight. Only once or twice since she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
could remember had any one come to the camp, for it was
in the very heart of El Nedjed, and there was little traveling
in those far-off days. Long before, when she was a tiny
girl, a traveler had come that way, and while he lingered
at camp, told of the blue Persian Gulf beyond the Oman
shore, and of the music of its plashing waves. No word
has such a magical sound to the Arab as “water,” and
to hear of lakes and rivers of it is like some exquisite
fairy tale.</p>

<p>“It is a desert of water more beautiful than the land,”
he said in the soft, sweet tongue of the East. “Houris
dwell there, and often when the moon is shining they come
out and sport upon the sands.”</p>

<p>The tale fascinated her at the time, and had always
stayed in her memory. That is why she was happy to see a
stranger approaching. She thought he might tell her of the
lovely realm beyond.</p>

<p>As the cloud rolled nearer they saw a rider on a milk-white
steed. Abi Ben Ahmed called to his men to come
and welcome the stranger, for an Arab who lets even one
slave stay away when a guest arrives, is lacking in courtesy.
So they advanced, stalwart, dark-skinned men, whose turbaned
heads were bowed almost to the ground as they gave
the low salaam of the East, while the chief spoke words of
welcome to his camp.</p>

<p>Very swarthy was the rider, and of proud demeanor that
proclaimed him a person of much consequence, and as he
returned Ben Abi’s salute he spoke with dignity befitting his
bearing.</p>

<p>“I bring greeting from the sheik Ben Nedi,” he announced.
“He rides this way tomorrow.”</p>

<p>The chief replied, “Mighty is Ben Nedi, and a man of
high esteem among his people. He shall have welcome and
all that Arab hospitality can offer.”</p>

<p>Then, leading the way, Ben Ahmed took the stranger to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the tent, where camel’s milk and dried goat’s flesh were set
before him.</p>

<p>Zuleika, on the sand without, could hear their words,
but the joyous light was no longer in her eyes. Her face
was drawn in wrinkles, and her lip quivered as if she were
about to cry. She knew that the man expected on the
morrow was not only a powerful chieftain, but a teacher
and prophet as well, and that according to the Arab custom
every person in camp, even to the lowliest slave, would lay
gifts before him. For it is believed by the desert people
that to do so brings a blessing. But Zuleika, although she
was a chieftain’s daughter, had nothing to offer, for the
wealth of Arab rulers is in their flocks and lands, and the
poorest child of the West has more treasures than had this
little princess of the desert.</p>

<p>“If I had my baby camel I could give that,” she thought
as she listened to the murmurs in the women’s tent and
knew that all was excitement there over the coming of the
stranger.</p>

<p>But the camel she had loved and petted had died a few
weeks before, and she had nothing else.</p>

<p>“Do not grieve,” her mother said when she saw tears in
the big almond eyes and asked the reason they were there.
“The law of giving does not apply to children, and the
sheik Ben Nedi, who is as wise as he is powerful, knows
that sometimes empty hands give most of all. The blessing
comes of having the great desire, not through the treasure
that is offered.”</p>

<p>But Zuleika did grieve, and the world seemed very dark.
And after she went to bed she thought about it until she
grew so restless she could not lie quietly. So she crept outside
and sat on the ground.</p>

<p>It was midnight, and Abi Ben Ahmed and the stranger
slept in the tent. The slaves, both men and women, were
sleeping too, and nothing broke the stillness of the desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
night save an occasional breeze that shifted the loose sand,
or a stirring among the animals just beyond. She sat there
for a minute, then stole out across the waste. Past the
camel keep she went, hurrying through the silver of the
moonlight until she came to a rock that rose out of the
desert like a grizzled head facing westward. It was her
favorite spot, for her mother had told her that a lovely houri
(fairy) once made her haunt there, and she hoped she might
come back and do wonderful things for her as she was said
to have done in the long ago. So she climbed up and
looked across the desert.</p>

<p>Away to the west, glowing more brightly than any other
in the sky, was the star that according to Arab teaching
shines always over Mecca, the city of the Prophet. The
sight of it made her grieve more than ever over the thought
of her empty hands, and she began to cry.</p>

<p>Then, with a sound of wonderful music, a white creature
rose out of the sands. Her beauty was more radiant than
any of which Zuleika had ever dreamed, and jewels of many
colors glistened in her hair. Her smile was wonderfully
sweet, and the girl knew it must be the good fairy returned
to her old haunt.</p>

<p>“Why do you weep?” she asked.</p>

<p>Zuleika answered with a low salaam, “The prophet comes
tomorrow, and I have nothing to offer him because the
baby camel I would have given is dead.”</p>

<p>“But you have a gift more precious than the others,”
the fairy spoke.</p>

<p>The little girl was amazed.</p>

<p>“I!” she exclaimed. “Why, I have nothing!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you have,” came the low reply. “The desire
in the heart. That is the only thing worth giving, and
that you have. But you shall have still another. Come
here in the morning at sunrise, and you will find it on the
sands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>The radiant creature glided away in the light, that dimmed
as she went, and in a moment Zuleika could see only the
desert and her father’s camp beyond the rock.</p>

<p>Creeping down, she went back to the tent to bed. But
the beauty of the shining creature was in her eyes and
brain, and she could not sleep. Eagerly she waited for the
coming of morning, and as soon as she heard a stirring beyond
the tents, and knew that Hassan, the camel keeper, was
looking after the animals, she bounded out of bed and down
to the place of rock. Her mother saw her go, but thought
nothing about it, for it was the time of gray dawn when
every Arab looks in prayer toward Mecca, and she was
probably going to the fairy rock for her devotions. But
Zuleika thought of something besides her prayers.</p>

<p>When she came to the spot she stared around, wondering
if it could be the place she had visited in the night. Then
only a glittering waste stretched far as the eye could reach.
Now there was a tree, straight and branchless almost to
the crown, where from beneath wide-spreading leaves hung
bunches of pulpy fruit. Nothing like it had been seen on
the desert before.</p>

<p>Wild with delight, she rushed back to camp and told of
the wonder.</p>

<p>“A tree on the desert!” her father exclaimed. “It cannot
be.”</p>

<p>Nor could she make him believe so strange a thing had
happened until she led him to the spot. But there it stood,
with head held high like an Arab sheik, and when he tasted
of the fruit he found it good.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon of the following day the caravan of
the sheik Ben Nedi came to the camp of Abi Ben Ahmed.
The women within the tents received him with singing,
and the men with low salaams. Then the gifts were brought:
the finest camels of the herd, turban cloth enough for all
the men of his train, and silk, a portion of her mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
marriage dower worth the price of many camels. It had
been brought by ship across the sea and by caravan over
the desert, and was rainbow-hued and fine, such as is woven
only in the Vale of Cashmere. The great man received
them with gratitude, and spoke words of praise for the
tribe of Ben Ahmed. “Surely nothing more splendid can be
set before a sheik,” he said.</p>

<p>But the chief smiled and answered, “Not so, O mighty
prophet! Zuleika’s gift, the finest of all, is yonder on the
desert.”</p>

<p>Then he led the way to the place of rock and pointed to
the wonder tree that had sprung up in the night. Ben Nedi
found the fruit cooling and sweet, and as he listened to the
story, he stood with dewy eyes.</p>

<p>“The gift of a child’s tears!” he exclaimed. “Yes, that
is most precious of all. The Arab will bless the day it
came to be.”</p>

<p>And the prophecy was fulfilled. It still grows in the
depths of the desert, the wonder tree of the East that men
call the date palm, and the Arab blesses it whenever he rides
that way. He knows that for a thousand years and more
it has been the salvation of the solitary wanderer across the
wastes, and that as long as it lifts its stately head above
the sands he will have food from its fruit, clothing from its
fiber, and shelter from the noonday heat.</p>

<h4>THE GIFT OF THE GNOMES</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Swiss Legend of the Alp Horn</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Geography—Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>In the days of long ago a chamois hunter, caught in a
storm on the mountains, took refuge in a deserted hut. The
floor was so wet and cold that to stay there was almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
bad as being out in the rain and hail, and so he climbed
into the loft and lay down on a pile of straw.</p>

<p>Just how long he slept he did not know, but after a while
he was awakened by the tinkle of bells and the lowing of
many cattle. That seemed very strange, for it was almost
winter, and Swiss herdsmen drive their flocks to the valley
early in the autumn. Yet as he looked out through the tiny
window he saw herds on every alp, herds hundreds strong,
cropping luxuriant grass that grew out of the snow.</p>

<p>Then he heard a noise below in the hut, and peeping down
through a knot hole, saw three strange-looking little men.
They were warming themselves beside a fire that blazed on
the hearth, and by their long green cloaks and red caps he
knew that they were gnomes of the Alps.</p>

<p>They were bustling about and seemed to be making cheese.
One of them stirred the milk in a big silver kettle, one
scurried in and out of the hut bringing fresh milk to add to
that which was already cooking, and one fed the fire with
moss and dry branches, which piled up out of the earth.</p>

<p>After a while one of the gnomes poured something into
the kettle, the second one brought out three golden bowls,
and the third blew a blast on a horn that was seven times
as large as himself.</p>

<p>Then the hunter heard the sound of cattle lowing nearer
and nearer, as if they were drawn by the music of the horn,
and a moment later a voice called out, “Come down from
the loft, Moni, and taste of the good things in the bowls.”</p>

<p>This amazed him, for he was sure they had not seen him,
and how could they know his name? But he crept down
from his straw pile, as he was bid, and into the room.</p>

<p>“Choose whichever you please,” the little man said, “and
besides the drink in the bowl you will receive a gift that
goes with the liquid of your choice.”</p>

<p>The golden bowls stood side by side on the floor, and
each one contained a different-colored liquid. One was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
red, like the wine of Geneva, one yellow as the honey of
Zurich, and the third was white like goat’s milk. Moni
looked from one to the other, deciding which to take. He
was hungry from his long tramp over the crags in the storm
and needed milk far more than honey or wine, so he chose
that bowl and drank greedily.</p>

<p>Then the little gnomes began to dance.</p>

<p>“Ah,” the cheese maker shouted, “you have won the
Alp horn!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” another exclaimed, “and it is a precious gift.
You can make other horns like it, and teach the people how
to call their herds, which will not stray away and be lost as
happens now. Thus the herdsmen will become very prosperous.”</p>

<p>“But remember, if you wish to be happy, you must give
up chamois hunting, and never again kill a harmless wild
creature.”</p>

<p>The gnomes disappeared, and with them went the cattle,
the kettle, and the shining bowls. But the horn lay where
the little man had dropped it, and as the hunter looked at
it he found it was pure silver. Catching it up, he ran down
the mountain side to the hut where his sweetheart lived.
He told her the story and showed her the Alp horn, and she
was very happy; for she never had wanted him to be a
chamois hunter, as the life was full of danger, and she loved
the poor little animals that he killed. Now he would tend
flocks as she did, and they would be happy in the life of
herding.</p>

<p>At first the hunter thought he could not change his ways,
for he loved to roam over the mountains and bound from
crag to crag in pursuit of the fleet-footed creatures, but the
promise of the gnomes and the pleas of Heidi persuaded
him, and he gathered a herd and tended it all summer.</p>

<p>He made an Alp horn like the one he had received in the
hut and gave it to the maiden, and sometimes as they tended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
their cattle on different sides of the valley, they would call
across to each other, and they were happy and contented—until,
one evening, he forgot the warning of the gnomes
and shot a chamois.</p>

<p>Then he raised his horn to call good night to his sweetheart.
But she did not answer. He blew blast after blast,
but only the echoes came back, instead of the sound of the
voice he knew and loved. Darkness fell and stars flashed
like diamonds above the snowy Jungfrau, and still he called
and sought her, but found no trace. The next morning, as
he moved with his herd, a boy told him of a strange happening.</p>

<p>“Last night at sunset time I was watching my goats,”
he said, “and saw a girl standing on the mountain side
above her cattle. She smiled as the wine color of the Alpine
glow crept down toward Chamounix, and throwing back
her head, sang one of our herd songs. Suddenly she disappeared,
but she could not have fallen, and just then an
arrow whizzed through the air and fell on the spot where
she had been standing.”</p>

<p>He took the arrow out of his peasant blouse and showed
it to the hunter, who recognized it as his own, the one he
had shot at the chamois.</p>

<p>Then Moni remembered the words of the gnomes, and
knew that because he had forgotten their warning he had
lost Heidi. He burned his arrows and sorrowfully went back
to herding, never again to shoot a wild creature of the hills.
By day he followed the cattle, and by night made Alp
horns, always thinking of his sweetheart. But he never
saw her again. Some of the herdsmen say that she fled in
grief because he broke his word to her, and some declare that
the gnomes carried her away to an ice palace in a crevasse.
But nobody knows. They know only that from that time
forth he tended flocks and made Alp horns, until every
herdsman in the mountains had one, and because they
could keep the cattle from straying and getting lost, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
became more prosperous than they had ever dreamed of
being.</p>

<p>Since then every peak and valley in Switzerland has resounded
to the notes of the Alp horn. Throughout the summer
time they are heard around the lakes of Zug and Geneva,
and the cattle follow them as the children of Hamelin town
followed the music of the piper. They echo along the
Jungfrau as the shepherds behind Interlaken call their
flocks together, and their weird sweet blasts mingle with
the songs of herd girls as they yodel to each other across the
ravines. Travelers from every land smile at the sound of
them, for one of the charms of going to Switzerland is in
hearing the Alp horns; but very few of these strangers
know that the mountain people say the reason the sound is
so magical to the cattle is because in the beginning the
horn came from the gnomes.</p>

<h4>THE DUTY THAT WASN’T PAID</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Biography—Music—Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>More than a hundred years ago a man and his two children
were journeying from their home in Salzburg to Vienna.
They traveled by the Danube boat, and Marianne, the sister,
stood by the rail tossing pebbles into the water and watching
the turbulent river swallow them up. Her dress was
worn almost threadbare, but her face was so sweet and her
eyes were so large and bright that she looked pretty for all
her shabbiness.</p>

<p>Just behind her on the deck her father and brother were
talking. “If we make some money in the city you’ll buy
sister a new dress, won’t you, Father?” little Wolfgang
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Marianne whirled and started toward him. She knew
that was sure to make her father sad, and she called, “Don’t
coax, Wolfgang. My dress will do very well until we can
afford to buy another, and a new one will seem all the nicer
because of my having worn this one so long.”</p>

<p>Her brother turned his big, earnest eyes upon her, and
answered, “But, Marianne, I know you want one. I heard
you wish for it by the evening star, and last night you
put it in your prayer.”</p>

<p>Father Mozart turned from them with a sad look on his
face, and walked up and down the deck, wishing very much
he could do what Wolfgang asked. But he was just a poor
orchestra conductor with an income so small he had to
stretch it hard to provide food and shelter for his family.
Marianne must wear the shabby frock until better times
began, which he hoped would be soon. They were to give
some concerts in the Austrian capital, and maybe in that
rich, music-loving city would earn enough to make them
more comfortable than they had been before. But until
then they must not spend a penny save what was needed
for food and shelter, because the customs fee on the harp
they carried must be paid, and that would reduce their
little fund to a very small amount.</p>

<p>Wolfgang, too, thought about it as the boat crept in and
out between the hills, and wondered much if there was no
way in which Marianne might have the dress before they
played in Vienna. His old teacher in Salzburg had often
told him that there is a way out of every difficulty if one is
clever enough to think of it, and there must be out of this.
But although he tried and tried he could not find one. His
own suit was bright and new, for his birthday was just past
and it had been his uncle’s gift. But Marianne was a very
shabby little girl, and he knew she was unhappy even though
she was brave and sweet about it.</p>

<p>They were gliding past the ruins of the castle that once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
men said, had been the prison of Richard the First, England’s
Lion-Hearted King, when his enemies took him captive
on his return from the holy wars. Wolfgang thought
of the many brave things that soldier ruler had done during
the Crusades, for often in the twilight time at Salzburg, as
they waited for the father to come from his work, the mother
told his tale, and of how the faithful servant Blondel found
him at last by singing a song he knew the master loved.</p>

<p>“He was very brave and wise, too,” the boy thought as he
looked at the crumbling pile. “He would have found a way
for Marianne to have a new dress if she had been his sister.”</p>

<p>Was it the prayer being answered, or just the fulfillment
of the wish made by the evening star? For while he thought,
an idea came into his head. It was a good idea, it seemed
to him, so good that it made him smile. If it worked out,
and he believed it would, Marianne might have the dress
she wanted so much, because then his father would have
more money to spend.</p>

<p>Just to the south they could see the great spire of St.
Stephens, a tall, gray finger against the sky, which told
that Vienna was not far away. As it grew nearer and nearer,
looming up bigger and plainer before them, Wolfgang thought
more and more of his idea, until when they reached the
mooring his eyes were dancing and his cheeks were aflame.
His father believed the thought of seeing the great capital
had excited him, but that was not it at all. He had a secret
plan and could hardly wait until he knew whether or not it
would work out.</p>

<p>The journey was ended and the people were going ashore.
“Please loosen the cover, Father,” he said as Leopold
Mozart carried the harp toward the customs gate.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are proud of it!” the man answered with a
smile.</p>

<p>Wolfgang did not reply, thinking what a poor guesser his
father was. He watched him as he set the instrument down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and undid the wrapping, bringing the polished frame and
glistening strings into full view. Then he went over and
took his place beside the harp as the customs officer drew
near, and Marianne came and stood beside him. She had
forgotten all about her shabby dress in her eagerness to find
out how much duty they would have to pay.</p>

<p>“What have you to declare?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Only a harp,” Leopold Mozart answered, as he laid his
hand on their one treasure.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful instrument and valuable,” the official
said as he looked at it, and named as the price of the duty
an amount so big as to cut their little hoard almost in half.</p>

<p>Father Mozart’s face grew very serious, and the merriment
went out of Marianne’s eyes. But Wolfgang did not
worry at all. He still had that idea in his mind, and believed
it would work out.</p>

<p>Leopold Mozart reached into his pocket for the little
sack containing his savings, but it was not necessary to open
it, for just as he was about to do so Wolfgang started to
play. The customs officer turned with a start and listened,
and the people gathered there forgot all about duty charges
as they crowded around the little musician. His tiny hands
swept the strings as if his fingers had some magic power,
and the melody they made was sweeter than any ever heard
on that old wharf. For five minutes, ten, he kept at it,
and there was not a whisper or a murmur, only a sort of
breathless surprise that one so young could play so wonderfully.</p>

<p>“What!” one exclaimed as he finished, “a lad of his age
to perform like that!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the father answered with a smile, “he does well at
the harp.”</p>

<p>“Amazing,” the officer murmured, “’tis amazing! I’ve
heard many a good harpist in my day, but never anything
sweeter than that. Play some more, boy,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Wolfgang smiled. The idea was working out, and he
was very glad. Already he had visions of a happy sister in
a handsome new gown, and turning again to the instrument,
he played even more beautifully than before, for the gladness
that crept into his heart was creeping also into the
music.</p>

<p>For some minutes he picked the strings, while the people
listened as if held in a spell, until the father said, “We must
go now, for it is getting late, and we have yet to find lodgings
in the city.” And he handed the money to the officer.</p>

<p>But the man shook his head. “No,” he said, and his
eyes were very tender as he spoke. “A boy who can give
as much pleasure as that deserves something. Keep the
money and buy a present for him.”</p>

<p>As Wolfgang heard the words he gave a bound. “Father,”
he exclaimed, with sparkling eyes, “buy the dress for
Marianne. You can do it now, since you have saved the
customs money.”</p>

<p>The officer looked at him in amazement. “He is a wonderful
lad, truly,” he exclaimed, “and as kind as he is
wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the low reply. “He has wanted nothing so
much as a new dress for his sister, and now he is happy
because he thinks she will get it.”</p>

<p>And she did get it, too, a beautiful one of soft, bright red,
all trimmed with shining buttons. Wolfgang danced with
delight when he saw it, and there was no happier child in all
that great capital.</p>

<p>They gave many concerts there, some before the royal
family; and Maria Theresa, the empress, became greatly
attached to both brother and sister, gave them handsome
clothes and beautiful gifts, and forgot all about affairs of
state while Wolfgang played. She called him the “little
sorcerer,” and agreed with the customs officer that he was a
wonderful child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, after some weeks, they went back to the home in
Salzburg, where the boy kept on at his music, doing such
marvelous things that his fame traveled far. He grew to
be the great master, Mozart, at whose glorious music the
world still wonders, and he was a generous and sweet-souled
man, just as he was a big-hearted and thoughtful child.
Many lovely acts are told of him, but none that shows his
kindness and tenderness in a more delightful way than
when as a boy on the Vienna wharf he charmed the customs
officer and all others who heard, and Marianne had the
dress for which she had wished by the evening star with
the duty money that wasn’t paid.</p>

<h4>WILHELMINA’S WOODEN SHOES</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Biography—Art Teaching</i>)</p>

<p>It was summer time, and a boy named Rembrandt van
Rijn was lying on top of the ramparts that walled in the
city of Leyden, his eyes fixed on the yellow highroad that
stretched away toward The Hague. It was good to be there
in the shadow of the mill sails, for the trees beyond were
beautifully green, and he loved to watch the market folk
coming and going, loved to see strangers journeying from
far away and to dream of the time when he, too, would fare
forth to see the world. Instead of being a miller like his
father and living always beside the Leyden ramparts, he
would go to Amsterdam, where ships sailed in from the
Indies, and perhaps he would board one of those wonderful
craft and journey over leagues of ocean to distant realms
of the East. The thought brought a smile to his face and
a deeper blue to his eyes, and he whistled a strain from an
old Dutch song of rejoicing.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started up in surprise, for a familiar figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
was coming along the Rhine road. It looked like his Uncle
Peter, but that seemed impossible, for it was Saturday morning,
and his uncle was an industrious merchant who was
never known to leave his shop on business days. Then as
the man hurried through the great gate that opened into
the city, Rembrandt saw that it was his Uncle Peter; and
his surprise changed to alarm, for he believed his uncle’s
coming would mean trouble for him.</p>

<p>The day before, in the Latin school, he had drawn pictures
on his cousin Wilhelmina’s wooden shoes and had been
caught. She was quite willing to have them decorated,
and laughed merrily at sight of the ducks and chickens and
spotted pigs marching from heel to toe; but Mynheer Speelburg,
the teacher, had a very different idea. He considered
that it was defacing property, and wasting one’s time as
well. Although Wilhelmina declared it was all her fault,
Rembrandt was severely scolded, and the master sent a
note home to his uncle. Now the uncle was probably coming
to tell the boy’s father about it, and the thought sent
all the brightness out of the day.</p>

<p>The merchant did not notice Rembrandt until he had
passed the ramparts and a cawing crow caused him to turn
and see the boy on top of the wall. Then he looked up and
smiled, which did not seem like anger, and yet—what
else could have taken him from the shop on Saturday
morning?</p>

<p>“I’ve come to have a talk with your mother,” he said as
he stopped a moment.</p>

<p>Rembrandt climbed down to go with him, hoping that
something besides the shoes had brought him, but the man
shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, stay where you are,” he said. “I want to see your
mother alone.”</p>

<p>Again the uneasy feeling surged over the lad. After all,
it must be those wooden shoes, and he felt very uncomfortable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and a little later, when both mother and uncle
came from the house and hurried to the mill, he wished
very much that he never had seen pigs and fowls—most of
all that he had not drawn them on his cousin’s shoes. Then
his father called to him, and although he wanted to creep
away and hide, he went on the run.</p>

<p>“Here’s the young rascal,” the uncle said as the boy
went in at the broad, low door. Rembrandt noticed that
he held one of Wilhelmina’s shoes, and his heart sank.
But a moment later he was as much amazed as he had
been alarmed, for his mother spoke pleasantly and asked,
“Would you really like to be a painter?”</p>

<p>“A painter?” he answered quickly. “More than anything
else in the world.”</p>

<p>Then his father smiled, too, which seemed strange indeed,
for he had declared that his son never should become an
artist. Often Rembrandt had dreamed of being one, and
when he spoke to his mother about it the idea seemed to
please her. But the sturdy Dutch miller shook his head
and announced that his boy must become a syndic, one of
the wise lawgivers of Holland, or else a miller like himself.
So, instead of being allowed to spend his days drawing the
pictures that were constantly running through his fancy,
Rembrandt had been sent to the Latin school to do sums
and conjugations. It seemed impossible that the miller
could have changed his mind; but he had changed it, for
he said, “Very well. We will see about it.”</p>

<p>Then, while the mill sails whirred above them, and the
voices of passing market folk came in through the open
window, the merchant uncle told what seemed to Rembrandt
a wonderful story.</p>

<p>“This morning, as I was opening the shop,” he began,
“Speelburg, the schoolmaster, came to talk about the pictures
on Wilhelmina’s shoes. He urged me not to be too hard on
the lad because he had thought much about it during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
night and had come to believe that perhaps Rembrandt
cannot help drawing. He is a wise man, this Speelburg,
and told me much of how the young masters Giotto, Cimabue,
and Raphael had made pictures on stones, sand, and
anything that would hold a drawing, and that their parents
could no more prevent it than they could keep water from
running downhill. He thinks our Rembrandt may be like
them, and so he offered to tend the shop for me if I would
come and ask you, his father, to let him study with Master
Swannenburg.”</p>

<p>Those words were music to Rembrandt’s ears, for Swannenburg
was the master painter of Leyden.</p>

<p>An hour later, miller and merchant went through the old
White Gate into the city, and Rembrandt trudged along
beside them, carrying a roll of paper. As they hurried along
the highway his eyes gleamed, for it seemed to him like a
dream come true, and the stern Dutch schoolmaster began
to appear in the guise of a fairy godfather. He did not see
the market folk they passed on the way, did not hear the
murmur of the Rhine sweeping seaward just beyond them,
for the thought that he might become a painter had crowded
out all other things.</p>

<p>Very soon they reached the workshop of the artist, and
knew what the great man thought of the sketches, for as
he looked them over he murmured, “H’m, h’m! Pretty
good! The old woman’s head is too small for her body,
and a pig never had legs as crooked as that; but he will
learn, and if he is willing to work I’ll gladly take him as a
pupil.”</p>

<p>So Rembrandt went into the studio of the painter, for
his father had come to believe that he was intended for
neither a syndic nor a miller. He was so eager to learn that
he worked with all his might, and his progress amazed his
teacher, who, although he knew he had talent, had not
dreamed he could advance so rapidly. Before two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
were gone his pictures were better than those of Swannenburg
himself, who said sadly one day, “I am no longer the
master painter of Leyden.”</p>

<p>But that artist had a great, good heart, and he was so glad
to see the boy’s progress that he helped him all he could.</p>

<p>Now it happened, about the time the work of the miller’s
son was causing Leyden folk to open their eyes, that Jan
Lievens, who was a successful painter in Amsterdam, came
home to visit his parents, who were neighbors of Rembrandt’s
family. He was greatly excited over the work of his young
friend and exclaimed, “You must go back to Amsterdam
with me, for the best masters of Holland are there, and you
must study with them.”</p>

<p>The idea seemed good to the miller, who was very proud
of the progress of his son; so to Amsterdam young Rembrandt
went, where he progressed as amazingly as he had
done in the studio of Swannenburg. The great harbor city
fascinated him, and he loved to roam along its splendid
streets watching the people hurrying to and fro or idling in
groups on the corners, laughing and chatting in their merry
Dutch way; loved to go to the docks where ships came in
from the Indies, and to see the sunrise and sunset painting
marvelous-hued pictures on the waves of the wild North
Sea. Then he would go back to the studio and work, picturing
the men and women he saw on his rambles, the mill
by the old White Gate, and the market folk he used to watch
from the Leyden ramparts. His paintings delighted the
great of Amsterdam just as the pigs and chickens he drew
on Wilhelmina’s shoes had delighted the boys and girls in
the Latin school, and he became rich and famous. He lived
in a palace fine enough for a prince, and could have bought
whole cargoes of those ships that sailed in from the Indies;
and his wealth seemed all the more glorious because he had
earned it with the labor of his hand and brain. He married
a great and gracious lady, and as his children drove through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the streets in their fine carriage the people would say, “See,
the son and daughter of Rembrandt van Rijn, the wonderful
painter.”</p>

<p>But all his good fortune and all the honors heaped upon
him did not make him selfish and overbearing. He never
forgot or ceased to love his native Leyden. He lived in
the harbor city because it fascinated him and was a better
place for an artist than his childhood town, but he never
tired of going back to the old home or lost interest in the
pigs and cows and the market folk on the Rhine road. Sometimes
on these visits he would lie on the ramparts just as
he had done when a boy, and strangers journeying to and
from The Hague had no idea that the grave-eyed man dreaming
there in the shadow of the mill sails was the famous
painter of Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Then, one day he died, and they laid him to rest in the
harbor city where for so many years he had lived and worked.
The people of Leyden asked to have him taken back there,
and those who know how he loved it wish it had been done;
for it would be pleasant to think of him sleeping in the
shadow of the mill sails, and perhaps if he could have been
asked he would have wanted it, too.</p>

<p>Years passed, but instead of dimming the glory of Rembrandt’s
name they brightened it. After his death his works
became priceless, and the world still prizes them just as
Amsterdam prized them two hundred years ago. To own a
canvas by this king of Dutch painters is to be rich and
envied, for it requires a great deal of money to buy one of
his paintings. Even the crude drawings of his boyhood are
now treasured by princes, and one of the most prized possessions
of a great museum in Holland is a pair of wooden shoes.
They are brown and clumsy and covered with marks, half
of which have been worn away by the staining finger of
Time; but a fortune could not buy them, because ever so
long ago they were worn by little Wilhelmina van Rijn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the Latin school of Leyden, and were decorated by the
hand of a mill boy, and who would not be proud to own
them? That mill boy became the immortal Flemish painter,
Rembrandt, whose work will be treasured as long as the
world loves beautiful things.</p>

<h4>THE LADY OF STAVOREN</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from a Dutch Legend</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Geography—Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>There was once, in Holland, a great and beautiful city
called Stavoren. It stood beside the sea, and many of the
inhabitants were proud and rich. They had houses stately
enough for royal palaces. They had gold and silver plate
and diamonds without number, and great oaken chests
filled with money. Their vessels sailed to the farthest parts
of the ocean and brought back treasures from every land,
and as the wealth of the people increased their selfishness
increased, until they thought of nothing but their good fortune
and had no pity for the poor.</p>

<p>Richest of all the rich folk in the city was a stately, beautiful
woman. There was no home in Stavoren as princely
as hers, there were no jewels as gorgeous or silks and velvets
as lustrous as those she possessed, and when she drove
through the streets in her gold-blazoned carriage her splendor
dazzled the eyes of all who saw. But she was as selfish
as she was rich and powerful, and always she pondered in
her mind the question, “How can I become richer still?”</p>

<p>One day she summoned the captain of her largest vessel
and said, “Make ready to sail at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” the officer replied, “but where shall I
go and upon what mission?”</p>

<p>“Where you go you must decide for yourself, for I care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
nothing about that. But you must bring back the most
precious cargo in all the world.”</p>

<p>The man looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“That shall I gladly do, madame,” he said, “if you will
but tell me what you wish. Is it to be gold and silver,
diamonds and jewels, or rare laces, tapestries, and velvets?”</p>

<p>The rich woman tossed her head and replied haughtily,
“There is but one thing in the world more precious than
all others, and what it is you must find out. I have given
my orders. Go now and fulfill them.”</p>

<p>The captain was greatly troubled, for he feared the anger
of his mistress. She was so powerful that she could have
him thrown into prison or even put to death if she chose,
and as he walked down the street from the house he thought,
“What is the most precious thing in all the world?”</p>

<p>Sometimes he thought it was one thing and sometimes
another, but when he reached the shipyard he had not
decided. He called to the officers and sailors standing there,
told them of the woman’s strange order, and said sadly,
“But, alas! I know not what it may be. If any among
you can tell, let him speak.”</p>

<p>Every one thought a minute, then came a chorus of suggestions.
One officer suggested gold, another silver, and
another precious stones, but the captain was not sure which
was right. He must not decide too quickly, for to make a
mistake would be a terrible thing.</p>

<p>Silently listening the sailors stood, for according to the
law of the city they must not open their lips until the officers
had had their say. Then one of the group, a slender, blue-eyed
fellow, who seemed no more than a boy, said, “No, my
captain! The most precious thing in the world is neither
gold and silver, pearls and diamonds, nor costly laces and
velvets. It is wheat, for without it we could have no bread,
and without bread we cannot live.”</p>

<p>Some of the officers laughed at this idea, for common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
sailors were not supposed to know much. But the captain
quieted them, saying, “He is right. We will sail away
and bring back a cargo of wheat.”</p>

<p>So they sailed out of the harbor, and across the Baltic to
Dantzic. There they bought a great cargo of wheat, the
largest that had ever been started out to sea, and the captain,
delighted with the purchase, turned the ship’s prow
back toward Stavoren town.</p>

<p>He could hardly wait to get to his mistress and tell her
what a wise and wonderful choice he had made. She
frowned when she saw him, displeased that he had returned
so soon.</p>

<p>“You must have flown like a pigeon,” she said. “Have
you brought me the cargo I ordered?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” he replied, bowing low before her. “I
have the finest cargo of wheat that ever went out of a port.”</p>

<p>The woman screamed in anger. “Wheat!” she yelled.
“A cargo of wheat! I told you to bring me the most precious
thing in the world, and do you mean to say that you have
brought a common, cheap thing like wheat?”</p>

<p>The captain was terribly frightened, but he did not regret
his selection. He believed in the value of his cargo, and
tried to lead the woman to see that he had made a wise
purchase.</p>

<p>“Pardon, madame,” he spoke. “Wheat is not cheap
and common. It is in truth the most precious thing in the
world, for without it we could have no bread, and without
bread we could not live.”</p>

<p>But he could not convince his mistress. She tossed her
head and wrung her hands in anger and exclaimed, “Wheat!
Wheat! Go to the port and throw your precious cargo of
wheat into the sea.”</p>

<p>The captain was horrified.</p>

<p>“Madame!” he exclaimed, “surely you do not command
me to do that! Wheat is precious. If you will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
have it yourself, give it to the poor and hungry, of whom
there are many in Stavoren.”</p>

<p>But she drove him from the house, saying, “Do as I bid
you. In a few minutes I shall come myself to see if you
have carried out my order.”</p>

<p>Sadly the man went down the street, wondering how one
so rich and beautiful could be so hard and unkind. But he
had no thought of executing the order. Instead, he told all
the poor he met, and dispatched messengers to tell others,
that his mistress had refused to accept the cargo of wheat
and perhaps, if they came to the port and asked her, she
would give it to them.</p>

<p>A little later the great lady of Stavoren drove in her
gold-emblazoned carriage to the shipyard, where a group of
men, women, and children had joined the sailors and stood
looking at the splendid vessel piled high with the best wheat
that ever came out of Dantzic. But when she saw them
her anger increased.</p>

<p>“Have you carried out my orders?” she said to the
captain, as he came in answer to her summons and stood
beside the carriage.</p>

<p>“No, madame, not yet,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Then,” the woman commanded, “do it at once. Throw
the cargo of wheat into the sea. I want to see, myself.”</p>

<p>But the captain shook his head. “See these poor people,”
he said, pointing to the hollow-eyed men, women, and
children who were standing there. “Give them the wheat,
for they are hungry.”</p>

<p>But the haughty woman silenced him and commanded,
“Throw it into the sea!”</p>

<p>Then the captain seemed afraid no longer. He stood
straight and fearless before her and declared, “Never,
madame!”</p>

<p>But she shouted word to the officers, who dared not disobey,
and amid the cries and pleas of the poor, the cargo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
that would have meant bread for thousands, was thrown into
the sea.</p>

<p>The woman watched the waters swallow it up and smiled
heartlessly. Then she called to the people, “Did you see
it go into the waves?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” they answered sadly.</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” repeated the captain, “and a day will
come when you will regret what you have done. A day will
come when you will be hungry, and no one will pity and help
you.”</p>

<p>The mistress looked at him in amazement. Then she
laughed loudly. “I, go hungry,” she exclaimed, “I, the
richest of all the rich of Stavoren! It is impossible!”</p>

<p>Then she took a diamond ring, held it up for the people
to see, and tossed it into the ocean. “When that ring returns
into my hand,” she said, “I shall believe what the
captain has said.” And she drove away in her splendid
carriage, and boasted to the citizens of what she had done.</p>

<p>The next day one of her servants came running to her in
wild excitement. “Madame,” she cried, “the cook has found
this in the stomach of a fish he is preparing for dinner.”
And she held up the diamond ring the woman had tossed
into the sea the day before.</p>

<p>The great lady of Stavoren opened her eyes wide and
wider. She was amazed and frightened, for she remembered
the captain’s words. “Can it be,” she thought, “that they
are to come true?”</p>

<p>It proved to be just as she feared, for that same afternoon
she received word of the destruction of all her ships, of the
loss of all her houses and lands, of the pillaging of her chests
of gold. She was no longer the richest woman in Stavoren,
but was as poor as any beggar. She went from house to
house, begging for food as pitifully as the people at the port
had begged her for wheat, but no one helped her, and at last
she died from cold and hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The other rich folk of Stavoren still lived on in the old
selfish way. They drove through the streets in sumptuous
carriages. They wore costly clothing and jewels, they
danced and feasted and sailed their vessels out across the
seas, forgetful of every one but themselves. There were
still many poor in the city, but they neither thought nor
cared about them. They believed themselves to be so great
and powerful that nothing could harm them, and they refused
to listen to advice.</p>

<p>After a while the port of Stavoren became blocked by a
great sandbank. It rose just at the spot where the lady’s
cargo had been thrown into the sea, and was covered with
wheat. Ships could no longer go in and out. Commerce
was ruined, and because there were no vessels to unload, the
poor lost the only way they had of making a living. They
begged the rich people to help them dig the bar away, but
they refused. They had enough to eat and plenty of gold,
so what cared they for the distress of the laborers?</p>

<p>Then something else happened. One night as they
feasted, a man came running into the banquet hall. “I
have found two fish in my well,” he said. “The dike is
broken. Protect the city! Protect the houses of the poor
that are close to the sea wall and will be swept away.”</p>

<p>But one of the great folk said haughtily, “Let the beggars
take care of themselves. The sea cannot harm us. We
must finish the banquet.” They turned away from him and
went on with their revelry, but only for a short time. A
few hours later the entire dike gave away, and the ocean
rolled in and covered the houses,—not only the huts of the
poor which were in the low quarter of the city, but even the
palaces of the rich who had declared they could not be harmed.
The great perished as well as the humble, and the waves of
the Zuider Zee rolled where the banquet laughter had sounded.</p>

<p>It rolls there still. The sailors say that sometimes when
the weather is fine and the sea is smooth as glass, they see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
spires and domes and stately columns far down under the
water. They declare, too, that often strange, weird music
like the sound of distant bells falls upon their ears, and then
they look and listen and nod to each other, for they think
of the palaces and chimes of Stavoren, once the fairest city
of the Netherlands, submerged hundreds of years ago while
the poor cried for help and the mighty danced.</p>

<h4>THE LUCK BOAT OF LAKE GENEVA</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Swiss Legend</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Geography</i>)</p>

<p>The Alpine herdsmen say that in the marvelous long ago
an enchanted boat was seen gliding up and down the blue
waters of Lake Geneva. Neither oars nor sails were needed
to speed it over the waves, for it was drawn by singing swans
and carried a fairy crew. A radiant creature in a robe whiter
than goat’s milk stood on the prow, her gleaming hair rippling
down over the hem of her garment. She bore a golden
basket of rare fruits and flowers, and although she scattered
the contents with lavish hand upon the sprites at her feet,
it was never empty. Sometimes the vessel touched the
shore, and then the soil around that spot produced as never
soil produced before or since, and if any peasant was so
fortunate as to catch a glimpse of the boat, he and his children
became rich beyond want and were blessed and happy
to the end of their days.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years the magic ship sailed the lake, and
as it touched the shore frequently and numbers of peasants
saw it, there was wonderful prosperity in Old Helvetia.</p>

<p>But a great misfortune befell the country and the glad,
abundant days became but a memory. A steamboat was
brought to Geneva, and it plowed, a screaming, snorting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
monster, across the waters. The noise terrified the gentle
swans, and with one wild cry they flew away. Never again
did the peasants catch a glimpse of the white-robed fairy
and the shining sprites. Never again did the music of the
snowy pilots gladden their ears.</p>

<p>The Luck Boat disappeared, and with it went prosperity
from the land of Geneva. But marvelous things like that
are never forgotten. Those who had seen the fairy craft
in their youth told the story to their sons and daughters,
who passed it on to their children and their children’s children,
and although the mountain folk of today have never
beheld it, they know just how it looked. They have pictured
it so often in their minds, that their artists have pictured
it on paper, and so it has become the custom for the
peasants around Lake Geneva to send “Luck cards” to
their friends on New Year’s Day. These are gay, colored
postals containing a likeness of the Luck Boat, and to those
of whom a peasant is fondest he sends as many as he can
afford, because to receive them is supposed to bring good
fortune, just as a glimpse of the swan-drawn vessel was said
to do in the marvelous long ago.</p>

<h4>WHY THE JAPANESE LOVE THE STORK</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Japanese Legend</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Geography</i>)</p>

<p>Ages ago, in the Japanese city of Nagasaki, there lived a
young and handsome noble named Vasobiove. Life seemed
very beautiful to him. He loved the blossoms that are so
sweet and abundant in his native Saikaido, loved the racing
and the wrestling matches, the sunset on the purple Gulf of
Sinabara, the evening festivals with the dances of the geisha
girls, and his only sorrow was the thought that he could not
live forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas, to have to leave this beautiful world!” he often
sighed.</p>

<p>At which his old father would say, “Fear not, my son.
By the time you are threescore years and ten you will think
differently.”</p>

<p>But the young noble would shake his head and reply,
“Nay, nay, I want to live always, always.”</p>

<p>One day an aged pilgrim came into Nagasaki and rested
on a stone outside Vasobiove’s garden. The owner was
walking under the tulip trees, and seeing the sad-looking man
in the sun and dust of the road, called and bade him come
into the shade of his park.</p>

<p>Leaning heavily upon his staff, the wanderer came and
sat down beside the fountain, and the young noble asked him
many a question of lands and men he had seen.</p>

<p>“Is it throughout the world as here in Japan,” he questioned,
“that people must die even while they yearn to live?”</p>

<p>The aged pilgrim nodded.</p>

<p>“Yea,” he answered, “in all the lands through which I
have journeyed. But men have told me that there is a
region where death never comes.”</p>

<p>The young noble leaned forward eagerly. “Where is it,”
he questioned, “ah, where? Tell me, for I mean to go to
that land.”</p>

<p>The pilgrim shook his head, saying, “That you cannot do,
my son. It is in the Happy Islands of Everlasting Life, but
although mortals have seen them in the distance, never has
one succeeded in entering there.”</p>

<p>“But I must, I will reach that land!” Vasobiove exclaimed.</p>

<p>His father, who was old and wise, begged him not to go.</p>

<p>“You will perish on the way,” he said sorrowfully. “But
even if you reach and enter the islands, you will not be happy.
That which is best for us is given to us, and after a long life,
death is good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>But Vasobiove shook his head and objected, “No, no!
I go to the Everlasting Islands.” And the next day he set
out from Nagasaki in a boat.</p>

<p>Straight southward he journeyed and eastward. Storms
raged and tropic heat beat fiercely on his head, but he pressed
onward, and at last, in spite of wave and tempest, reached
the green shore of Horaisan. It was the land no mortal
had ever entered, the Happy Islands of Everlasting Life.</p>

<p>Vasobiove’s cup of joy was full. There was no sorrow
there, no birth or death, no tempest and black weather or
flight of time—nothing but dancing, music, splendid men
and beautiful women, with enchanted flowers of unfading
beauty in the groves and gardens, and always iridescent
reaches of the sea beyond. There were wrestling matches,
such as were not dreamed of in Nagasaki, long days filled
with feasting, and long nights of dance and song.</p>

<p>Vasobiove smiled the smile of the contented.</p>

<p>“At last!” he said. “It is good to know that I shall live
forever.”</p>

<p>Two hundred years he spent in the eternal mirth of Horaisan,
and then, somehow, he longed for other things. The
music he had loved grew wearisome, the never ending dance
became hateful to his eyes.</p>

<p>He wanted to return to Nagasaki, but there was no way.
The boat that had carried him to the islands had long since
fallen into decay, and it was impossible to get another. He
must stay forever and ever in the land of dance and song,
and the thought became hideous.</p>

<p>Then he heard a weird cry. Looking behind him, he saw
a giant stork settling on the bank of a lake to catch some of
the rainbow fish within.</p>

<p>A happy thought came to him. No, he would not dwell
eternally in Horaisan. He would go back to Nagasaki.</p>

<p>Catching the bird, he tamed it, and one morning while the
islanders reveled and the sea was as many colored as the enchanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
blossoms in the gardens, he flew away, borne by the
giant stork back to the sweet land of Saikaido, back to the
shining Gulf of Sinabara, and his native Nagasaki. He
would live as his fathers had lived, he would die when his
time came, and never again would he pine for a land where
all was revelry and beauty and song.</p>

<p>Ever since that time the Japanese have loved the stork.
They picture it upon their royal banners and upon the walls
of their houses, and give it the freedom of their gardens.
Whenever a youth becomes dissatisfied and yearns for a
land where delights are never ending, they tell him the story
of the man who went to the Everlasting Islands, show a
picture of the stork that carried him back to Nagasaki, and
say,</p>

<p>“Even as it was with Vasobiove, so would it be with you.”</p>

<h4>WHY GRIZZLY BEAR GOES ON ALL FOURS</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Shasta Legend. Adapted from Bancroft</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Indian Folk Tale—Geography—Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>Ages ago, before there were any mountains or valleys or
rivers flowing seaward, Great Spirit lived up in the sky,
higher than the most distant star. All about him were snow
heaps and white cloud billows, so thick he could not see
through them, and he wondered what lay beyond.</p>

<p>“I will make a hole and see,” he said.</p>

<p>So, taking a sharp rock, he bored an opening through the
cloud floor and looked below. A strange sight met his eyes.
There lay the world, but a very different world from the one
we know. It was flat like a table, with no hills or valleys,
or rivers, or growing things, and Great Spirit said, “I will
build a teepee there, and then I shall make it better.”</p>

<p>The snow heaps lying around him made him think of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
good way of building a wigwam; so he pushed some down
through the floor window, working day and night through
many, many moons, until he had the pyramid white men
call Mount Shasta. He built a fire and lived in the teepee,
and then he walked abroad.</p>

<p>It was a fine land for a home, but lonely and too flat. He
wanted mountains and valleys; so he created them. Then
he wanted living and growing things about him; so he said,
“I will make men and animals too.”</p>

<p>He dug holes in the ground with his fingers, some large,
some small, and when he breathed into them, trees of many
sizes and kinds rose out of the earth. Then he stripped
leaves from the branches and scattered them about, and
they became men. He caused snow from the mountain
sides to melt and flow in streams, and now, instead of the
flat, brown vastness, there were uplands and lowlands, green
fields and snowy peaks, and rivers running seaward, and
other leaves stripped from the branches and torn into bits
became fishes that swim.</p>

<p>“Now I shall make beasts of every kind,” he said, and as
he spoke he smote down a mighty tree. He broke it into
pieces, some large, some small, which he turned into animals
of various sizes and varying strength. Grizzly Bear he
created from the heaviest part of the trunk, and the bear
stood before him, on his hind legs, straight and powerful
like a young hunter, stronger than any other creature of the
earth.</p>

<p>It pleased Great Spirit to have living creatures around
him, and he did not go back to the cloud world, but stayed
in the teepee. The Indians knew he was inside, because
often they saw the smoke from his flaming coals curl far
above the peaks.</p>

<p>Many, many moons he dwelt there and grew so lonely
that he sent for Little Daughter. She came and lived with
him, made his moccasins and tended his fire, and was happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>One day there was a mighty storm. The wind raged
fiercely, sending the smoke back through the smoke hole
into Great Spirit’s face. He did not like that, and bade
Little Daughter go up to command the wind to stop.</p>

<p>She did as she was told, and put her head out through the
hole to call to the wind. But never having beheld the world
before, she grew very curious at the strange sights that met
her eyes, and leaned out far, far, to see all she could.</p>

<p>Suddenly she fell, and the wind carried her to the land of
the Grizzly Bear. Little Daughter did not want to stay there
and begged to be taken back to the teepee of her father.</p>

<p>“Let her stay here and work for me,” Mother Grizzly
growled, and Young Grizzly agreed, saying, “Yes, let her
work.”</p>

<p>So they would neither go with her nor let her try to find
the way herself.</p>

<p>Great Spirit knew Little Daughter was in the land of the
Grizzly Bear, and he went to take her home. When she told
him how she had begged to go back, but was forced to stay
and work, he was very angry.</p>

<p>“I shall punish you,” he said to the bears. “Never again
shall you walk upright like a man; always you must go on
all fours.”</p>

<p>Taking Little Daughter, he went back to the snow teepee,
and they lived there for ages and ages, always keeping the
fire burning, and always the Indians saw the smoke come out
through the smoke hole.</p>

<p>At last the white men came, and as Great Spirit did not
like the palefaces, he went away and the fire died out. But
the teepee they call Mount Shasta is still there, although
smoke no longer curls above it, and Grizzly Bear still goes on
all fours, never standing upright except when he is fighting.</p>

<h4>THE LUCK BOY OF TOY VALLEY</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Geography—Ethics—Manual Training</i>)</p>

<p>In a chalet high up among the Austrian mountains, blue-eyed
Franz was very unhappy because his mother and brother
Johan were going to Vienna and he had to stay at home with
his old grandfather. He bit his lips to keep back the tears
as he watched the packing of the box that was to carry their
clothing. Then his mother tried to comfort him.</p>

<p>“Never mind, lad,” she said. “I’ll send you a present
from Vienna, and we’ll call it a ‘luck gift’ and hope it will
bring good luck. If it does you’ll be a luck boy.”</p>

<p>He smiled even if he did feel sad. He had often heard of
luck children, for among the Tyrolean peasants there were
many stories of those who had been led by fairies to have
such wonderful good fortune that ever afterward they were
spoken of as the elf-aided, or “Glücks Kinder,” and it was
so delightful to think about being one of them that he forgot
his sorrow. Of course it would be very fine to travel down
to Vienna and go into the service of a rich noble there, as
his mother and brother were to do, but it would be still
better to be a “Glücks Kind,” and such things sometimes
did happen. So he did not feel sad any more, but whistled
and sang and helped with the packing.</p>

<p>Early next morning the post chaise rattled up to the door,
and Johan and the mother drove away. Franz watched
them go down the winding white road, calling after them
in sweet Tyrolean words of endearment until they were out
of sight. Then he went back into the hut and began to
sandpaper some blocks that his grandfather needed for his
work. The old man was a maker of picture frames, all
carved and decorated with likenesses of mountain flowers,
and these, when sent to Innsbruck and Vienna, brought the
money that gave him his living. The figures were too fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and difficult for Franz to carve, but he could lend a hand at
fetching blocks and sandpapering. He worked with a vim,
for Tyrolean boys think it a disgrace to shirk, but all the
while his thoughts were on the luck gift.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it will be?” he said to his grandfather.
They took turns at guessing, until it was time to feed the
goats and house the chickens for the night.</p>

<p>A week later the man who had driven Johan and his
mother away came by on his return from Vienna, and Franz
fairly flew out to get his gift.</p>

<p>“It is something very big,” he called to the old frame
maker as he took a bulging bag. “See, it is stuffed full!”
And he expected to find something very wonderful.</p>

<p>But when he opened it, he thought it wasn’t wonderful
at all. There was a blue velvet jacket, trimmed with gold
braid and fastened with glittering buttons, such as Tyrolean
boys wore in those days, and in one of the pockets
he found a shining knife.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” he exclaimed as he held them up for
his grandfather to see. “It’s a splendid jacket, and the knife
is a beauty, but I don’t see where the luck part comes in.”</p>

<p>But Hals Berner was old and wise, and a knowing smile
played over his wrinkled face as he spoke. “It won’t be
the first time luck has hidden in a knife,” he said, as he bent
over his carving.</p>

<p>Franz did not know what he meant. He had always had
a knife, for being of a carver’s family he was taught to
whittle when he was a very little fellow, and he had become
remarkably skillful for one of his years. But no wonderful
good fortune had come to him, and he was very sure that
although each of the presents was nice, neither would bring
luck, and he sent that word to Johan. But the brother wrote
back from the city, “It will surely turn out to be a luck gift,
Franz. Just wait and see.” And still the boy wondered.</p>

<p>Winter came and icy winds blew down from the peaks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
There was no word from Vienna now, for the valley was shut
in by a glittering wall, and travel over the snow-drifted
passes was impossible. There were other boys in the village,
but each had his work indoors, and there was little time to
play, so Franz had no chance for games. He helped his
grandfather part of the day and sometimes whittled for his
own amusement. It was a lonely life there in the hut, with
just the old frame maker, who was often too busy to talk, so
Franz was glad to do something to keep him busy. Now he
made rings and tops and then just fantastic sticks or blocks.</p>

<p>One day, as he whittled, his grandfather said, “Why
don’t you make an animal, Franz?”</p>

<p>The boy looked up in surprise. “I don’t think I can,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“Not unless you try,” came the reply. “But if you do
that you may surprise yourself.”</p>

<p>Franz hated to have any one think he was afraid to make
an attempt, so he exclaimed, “I wonder if I could make a
sheep?”</p>

<p>“Begin and see,” the old man advised.</p>

<p>The boy went to work. At first it was discouraging. After
many minutes of whittling there was little to suggest what he
had in mind. But then, with an occasional turn of the knife
by the frame maker, and now and then a bit of advice, the
boy began to see that a sheep would grow out of the block,
and when it did he felt like a hero who has won a battle.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a bit hard, was it, lad?” Hals Berner asked
when it was finished.</p>

<p>And Franz agreed that it was not.</p>

<p>That was the beginning, and every day thereafter Franz
worked at his whittling, and animal after animal grew under
his knife. He was so busy he did not have time to be lonely,
and had quite forgotten how sad he had felt over having to
stay at home. It was such fun to see the figures come out
of the wood and feel that he had made them. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
they were crude, and not half so handsome as those his
grandfather could have made; but any one could tell what
they were, and that was worth a great deal.</p>

<p>By spring he had a whole menagerie, and when his mother
came home she found he had been a busy boy, and a happy
one as well.</p>

<p>“All made with the luck knife,” Johan said as he looked
over the work.</p>

<p>“So grandfather says,” Franz answered. “It’s a splendid
knife, but I don’t see yet where the luck comes in.”</p>

<p>And again the knowing smile went over the old man’s face.</p>

<p>One day soon afterward his mother had word from the
man who had been her employer in Vienna that his little son
was not well, and he was sending him to regain his health in
the mountain air. A week later the child arrived with his
nurse, and the first thing that attracted his attention was
Franz’s menagerie.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” he exclaimed, “dogs, cats, sheep, goats,
lions, elephants, and all made of wood! I want them.”</p>

<p>“He means that he wants to buy them,” his nurse explained.
“Will you sell them, Franz?”</p>

<p>For a minute the boy hesitated. That menagerie had
meant many months of whittling, and he loved every animal
in it, and if Johan hadn’t interrupted, probably he would
have refused.</p>

<p>“Why, Franz,” the brother exclaimed, “it begins to look
like a luck knife after all.”</p>

<p>That put a thought into his mind that caused him to
answer, “Yes, take them. I can make some more.”</p>

<p>So, when the child went back to Vienna he took a wooden
menagerie from the Tyrolean mountains. Other Viennese
children, seeing it, wanted to possess one, and orders began
to pour in to Franz, far more than he could fill. Then other
villagers took up the work, until all over the valley people
were making animals and toys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>The work grew to be a big industry, and toys from the
Grödner Thal were sent all over Germany, and even to the
lands beyond. One generation after another went on with
the work, and although it is two hundred years since Franz
began it, the craft continues there to this day. At Christmas
time shops in every land are filled with toys from the Tyrolean
mountains, and although they do not know the story,
thousands of children have been happier because of a peasant
boy’s whittling.</p>

<p>So out of the bag sent back from Vienna there came in
truth a luck gift, and it wasn’t the fine jacket either, but the
knife with which Franz whittled his first sheep. The boy
had found out that luck doesn’t mean something sent by
fairies, but the doing a thing so well that it brings a rich
reward, and although he lived to be a very old man, he
never got over being grateful that his mother made him
stay behind when she and Johan went to the city.</p>

<p>The little valley among the Austrian Alps is still called
Grödner Thal on the maps, but because of the animals and
toys that have come out of it, it is almost as well known by
another name. If you are good guessers you can surely tell
what it is, especially if you know that the peasants still speak
of the lad who made the first menagerie there as the Luck
Boy of Toy Valley.</p>

<h4>THE EMPEROR’S VISION</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Medieval Legend—Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>When Augustus was Emperor of Rome and Herod was
King of Jerusalem, a great and holy night sank down over
the earth. It was the darkest night that any one had seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and one could not find the way on the most familiar road.
How could it be otherwise, since all the stars stayed at home
in their houses and the fair moon hid her face?</p>

<p>The silence was as profound as the darkness. The rivers
stood still in their courses, the wind did not stir, and even the
aspen leaves had ceased to quiver. Everything was as
motionless as if turned to stone, and the grass was afraid to
grow, lest it disturb the holy night.</p>

<p>There was no cruelty or wickedness. Wild beasts did not
seek their prey, but lay in the forest depths and wondered;
serpents did not sting or dogs bark, and no false key could
have picked a lock, no knife could have drawn a drop of
blood.</p>

<p>In Rome, the mighty city, a group of people came from
the Emperor’s palace at the Palatine and took the path across
the Forum which led to the Capitol. During the day the
senators had asked the Emperor if he had any objection to
their erecting a temple in his honor on Rome’s sacred hill,
but he had given no answer. He did not know if it would be
agreeable to the gods for him to own a temple next to theirs,
and he wanted to ascertain their will in the matter by offering
a sacrifice. Therefore he and his trusted friends were
on their way to the Capitol.</p>

<p>Augustus let them carry his litter, for he was old and the
stairs leading to the Capitol were long. He held in his hands
the cage of doves for the sacrifice. No priests or soldiers
accompanied him, only his nearest friends. Torch bearers
walked in front of him to light the ways through the black
darkness, and behind him followed slaves who carried the
tripod, knives, and charcoal for the sacred fire. He chatted
gayly with his followers, and all were so interested in the
conversation that they did not notice the stillness over the
earth. Only when they reached the highest point on Capitol
Hill did they realize that something unusual was taking place.</p>

<p>There they saw a most remarkable thing. An old woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
so bent and twisted that at first they thought it must be a
distorted olive tree, was standing on the very edge of the
cliff, and they knew her to be the sibyl who had lived as
many years as the sand grains by the sea.</p>

<p>“Why does she come from her cave tonight?” they
whispered. “What does she foretell for the Emperor and
the Empire?”</p>

<p>She stood there as if she had gone up on the hillside that
she might see what was happening far away, and the night
was so dark, so dark!</p>

<p>Then Augustus and his retinue remarked how profound
was the stillness. They could not hear even Tiber’s hollow
murmur, and they feared some disaster was impending.
But no one cared to show that he was afraid. They told
Augustus it was a good omen, and counseled him to hurry
with the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The sibyl seemed not to notice the Emperor’s train moving
up to the Capitol. In fact, she did not see them. She
was in a distant land making her way over something higher
than grass tufts. She was walking among great flocks of
sleeping sheep.</p>

<p>Then she saw a shepherd’s fire. It burned in the middle
of the field, and she groped her way to it. The shepherds
lay asleep in its glow, and beside them were the long, spiked
sticks with which they defended their flocks from wild
beasts. Jackals with glittering eyes and bushy tails stole
up toward the blaze, but the men did not hurl the sticks
at them. The dogs continued to sleep, the sheep did not
flee, and the beasts of prey lay down to rest beside human
beings.</p>

<p>Only this the sibyl saw. She did not know that a sacrificial
fire was being kindled behind her. She did not see
the Roman Emperor take a dove from the cage to use as an
offering. She was in the far hills of Galilee, among slumbering
shepherds and sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, wonderful sight, a company of angels singing gloriously
flew back and forth above the wide plain. They
moved in long, swaying lines like migratory birds. Some
held lutes in their hands, some zithers and harps, and their
songs rang out as merry as child laughter, as carefree as
lark trills. The shepherds wakened, marveling at what they
heard and saw, then rose up to go to the mountain city to
tell of the miracle.</p>

<p>Behind the sibyl, on the summit of Capitol Hill, still
stood the train of Augustus. But he did not make the
sacrifice. Although he exerted his full strength to hold
the dove’s frail body, it flung itself free and disappeared
into the night.</p>

<p>And the shepherds, what of them?</p>

<p>They groped their way forward on a narrow, winding path.
Suddenly, in the light up there on the mountain, a great
heavenly body kindled, and the city beneath it glittered
like silver in the starlight.</p>

<p>All the fluttering angel throngs hastened thither, shouting
for joy, and the shepherds hurried so that they almost ran.
Upon reaching the city, they found the angels had assembled
over a stable near the gate. It was a wretched structure
with a roof of straw, and a naked cliff for a wall. But over
it hung the star, and thither flocked more and more angels.
Some seated themselves on the roof or alighted on the steep
mountain wall back of the house, others poised themselves
in air on outspread pinions, while high up, high up, the sky
was illuminated by creatures with wings as white as pearl.</p>

<p>The instant the star kindled over the mountain city all
nature awoke. Trees swayed, the Tiber began to murmur,
stars twinkled, and the moon stood out of the sky and lighted
the world. Out of the clouds a dove circled down and
alighted on the shoulders of Augustus.</p>

<p>The Emperor was proud and happy, and his friends and
slaves fell at his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hail, Cæsar!” they cried. “Thou art the god who shall
be worshiped on Capitol Hill!”</p>

<p>This cry of homage was so loud that the sibyl heard it
and roused from her vision. She turned from her place at
the edge of the cliff and came down among the people, so
twisted, so shriveled, so terrifying in her tangled hair and
marks of age, that they fell back in awe. With one hand
she clutched the hand of the Emperor, with the other she
pointed toward the east.</p>

<p>“Look!” she commanded.</p>

<p>The vaulted heavens opened before his eyes, and his
glance traveled slowly to the distant Orient. He saw a
lowly stable behind a steep rock wall and shepherds kneeling
in an open doorway. He saw a young mother with a
child upon her knees, resting on a bundle of straw.</p>

<p>The sibyl’s big, knotty fingers pointed toward the Babe.</p>

<p>“Hail, Cæsar!” she cried in a burst of scornful laughter.
“There is the God who shall be worshiped on Capitol Hill!”</p>

<p>Augustus shrank back from her as from a maniac. But
upon the sibyl fell the mighty spirit of prophecy. Her dim
eyes began to burn, her hands were stretched toward heaven,
her voice rang out with such resonance and power that it
must have been heard throughout the world. And she
uttered words which she seemed to be reading among the
stars.</p>

<p>“Upon Capitol Hill shall the Redeemer of the world be
worshiped—Christ, but not frail mortals.”</p>

<p>When she had said this she strode past the terror-stricken
men and disappeared down the mountain.</p>

<p>On the following day Augustus forbade the people to raise
a temple to him on Capitol Hill. In place of it he built a
sanctuary to the new-born God-Child, and called it <i>Heaven’s
Altar</i>—Ara Cœli.</p>

<h4>THE SHEPHERD WHO TURNED BACK</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from a Syrian Legend</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>This is a story they tell in Palestine when the Christmas
stars shine out and Syrian children sit, cross-legged and big-eyed,
in front of the old grandfather, listening to his tales
by the light of the charcoal fire, while the moon flings its
veil across the jagged Hebron Hills and the far, high peaks
out Moab way are white as wool.</p>

<p>On the wonderful night when the star in the east proclaimed
glad tidings to the Magi, and these three wise ones
started away from their pleasant homes on a long and perilous
journey, marvelous things are said to have happened in
every quarter of the earth. Away in imperial Rome, the
Emperor Augustus, straight and proud in his litter, was
borne up the long stairway leading to Capitol Hill to invoke
his gods on the spot where the people were to erect a temple
to him. But suddenly the darkness broke away and he
beheld a manger in a distant land and a Babe wrapped in
swaddling clothes, and as the voices of his subjects shouted,
“Hail, Cæsar, thou art the god who shall be worshiped on
Capitol Hill!” instead of feeling great and exalted like a
sovereign he felt very small and humble, for he knew that
One just born was mightier than Cæsar, and would rule not
only Rome, but all the earth.</p>

<p>And on that same night, where the mountains break
southward from Bethlehem to form the high plateau of Bêt
Sahûr, there were shepherds guarding their white-fleeced
charges—six in all, five of whom slept by the gate of the
sheepfold while one walked up and down, starting whenever
he heard a stirring among the flocks and going in the
direction of the sound to make sure that all was well.</p>

<p>Sometimes he added wood to the fire, for the night was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
cold and a wind from the white peaks eastward brought
numbness to his hands, and sometimes he stood and looked
over the scene he knew so well—the pools of Solomon,
shimmering darkly under the moon, and the broad vales
of Boaz, bare and lifeless now, but yellow with ripened
grain and gay with reapers’ songs in harvest time. As a
child he had played there with his brothers, as a boy he had
roamed up and down the ravines, and now, alone in the
darkness, it gladdened him to live again those days in memory.</p>

<p>Midnight drew near, yet he had no desire to sleep. The
world was very silent, very still, for the wind had died away,
and the Ilwa, in its rocky bed below, seemed to rest instead
of surging Jordan-ward. Into the hoot of the owls came a
note of unwonted tenderness, and even the cries of the
jackals, that always made the night watch hideous and sent
terror to the hearts of the herders, softened to a sound like
a song. The man felt the calm and it soothed him, and
although he had followed the flocks all day long and the
hills were steep and jagged, he knew no weariness, but a
strange sense of peace and delight, and as he looked at his
companions wrapped in their rough skin coats and dreaming
beside the embers, he wondered if they felt in sleep a
sensation as exquisite as the one he experienced awaking.</p>

<p>“How bright the heavens are tonight!” he thought as he
looked up to where a golden haze began to gleam around
the crescent of the moon. Billions of stars glittered in the
purple spaces, and directly over the center of the fold was
a cluster large and brilliant that he had not seen before.</p>

<p>It grew warmer, too, and instead of the sting of winter
that had kept the men close by the fire after darkness fell,
a balm came into the air, a softness like that of May. Never
had he dreamed there could be such a winter night, and
almost he felt tempted to rouse his companions that they
too might enjoy it.</p>

<p>But suddenly he stiffened and stood watching, cold with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
fear. A glory came, and across the sky, which flamed as
if on fire, floated a white-winged heavenly host singing the
glad tidings of the Messiah come. The flocks started up
and ran wildly about the fold. The sleeping shepherds
wakened and crouched on the ground, half dazed with fear.</p>

<p>The bright ones flew about the heavens. They moved
in shining columns down from the heights and fluttered
above the fold, whiter than the sheep, then glided across to
the rugged cliffs, and sat there as if on couches of down. And
ever as they marched or floated or poised on glittering pinions
ready for another flight, they blended their voices in a
triumphal chorus as if all the hosts of heaven had descended
to make melody among the Judean hills.</p>

<p>“What is it?” one of the shepherds asked in a voice that
shook.</p>

<p>Then, like an answering message, came a jubilant anthem,
“Fear not, for unto you is born this day in the city of David,
a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.”</p>

<p>As if a soothing hand had touched their fleeces, the sheep
settled to rest again; the fear left the hearts of the shepherds,
and in a radiance which dimmed and paled as they went,
the shining ones floated upward out of sight, singing, “Glory
to God in the Highest, Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men.”</p>

<p>For several minutes the keepers of the flocks stood silent,
too bewildered either to think or to speak. Then, by the
peace among the sheep and the perfect calm of the night,
they realized a marvelous thing had happened, and one of
the herders lifted his voice.</p>

<p>“Didst hear?” he spoke in tones of reverence. “They
say the Christ is born.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” a companion answered, “in the city of David,
which is Bethlehem. Let us go and seek him.” And his
comrades, speaking agreement, said they would journey
there together.</p>

<p>Now, when subjects go into the presence of a loved sovereign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
they bear with them tokens of loyalty and affection.
Those who are rich give priceless gifts, and those who are
poor offer the best out of their scanty possessions and the
fullness of their hearts. And so these herders of Bêt Sahûr,
having nothing but their flocks, each chose the lamb he
prized most, and cradling it tenderly in his firm, warm arms,
left the sheepfold and started for the town.</p>

<p>Down over the cliffs they hurried, along perilous slopes
and across chasms that seemed like great black mouths
agape; yet they did not fear, for a light from above showed
the path as plain as noontide and there was no danger of
falling. From one rock to another they proceeded, from
ledge to ledge they made their way, and soon were well down
into the ravine, from the bottom of which the road led to
the town. Directly above, so close that had they looked
up they could have counted some of them, the sheep lay
white and shining under the stars; but the thoughts of the
shepherds were on Bethlehem, which, straight ahead, still
showed a few flickering tapers, and not on the flocks behind.</p>

<p>Ben Ezra, he who had stood on the night watch, was the
most stalwart of the six, and he it was who led the descent
to the valley.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he exclaimed when at last their feet struck the white
firmness of the road, “from here on the way is smooth and
easy. Let us hasten, brethren, and soon we shall be there.”</p>

<p>And as he spoke he smoothed the fleece of the warm,
white bundle he carried, which bleated softly at his caress.</p>

<p>Just then was heard the cry of a lamb.</p>

<p>The shepherds stopped and listened, for having spent
their lives among the flocks, they knew the helplessness of
the sheep, and although rugged, fierce-looking men, their
hearts were tender toward the weak and appealing. The
bleat of a ram or ewe never failed to call them from their
meals by day or their rest by night; and now other thoughts
left their minds, and they remembered only their charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
alone on the hill. Then, thinking of the glory in the sky
and the word of the heavenly host that the Christ was born
in Bethlehem, one of them said, “Come. Methinks all is
well. Did we not feel on the hills that God would take care
of the sheep? Let us on to Bethlehem and seek the King.”</p>

<p>But another of the number, he who stood sentinel while
his comrades slept, shook his head and demurred.</p>

<p>“Nay,” he said. “Take my lamb and say ’tis the gift
of Ben Ezra, but I must go back. It is my night on the
watch, and a good shepherd is not deaf to the cry of a sheep.”</p>

<p>He gave his tiny white burden into the keeping of one of
his companions and turning, hurried back to the cliffs,
while the others went ahead to Bethlehem. He knew it
would take much longer to make the climb than it had taken
for the descent, and a fear seized him that perhaps jackals
had broken upon the flock and he might reach the fold too
late to save the sheep. But as he moved forward the mounting
of the first cliff seemed no task at all. Hands invisible
seemed to lift him up the mountain way, and he reached the
sheepfold easily and quickly.</p>

<p>A great relief came. The flocks lay silent, stirring only
when a lamb or ewe moved a white leg and turned as it
slept, but there was no sign or sound of danger, not even
the howl of a jackal away on the mountain side or the moving
shadow of a panther creeping stealthily upon the fold.
Then he knew that in truth God was watching over the sheep,
and that the lamb had probably cried out in wonder, even
as he and his brethren might have done.</p>

<p>Secure in the thought that the flock was safe, he started
down the mountain toward Bethlehem, musing upon the
strange things that had come to pass that night. His comrades
were far ahead, and he knew he could not overtake
them. Perhaps already they had reached the town and
found the place of the Child, while he yet had a long way to
go. But his feet sped over the spaces and he swung lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
along, the shaggy skin of his shepherd’s cloak flapping as
he went. He was not sorry he had gone back, even though
it meant he must journey alone, for there was a peace in his
heart that could not have been there had he gone ahead
hearing the cry of a lamb.</p>

<p>At last he reached Bethlehem and asked one of the soldiers
who guarded the gate, “Where is it that the Christ is born?”</p>

<p>“The Christ?” the man repeated like one dazed. “He
is not in Bethlehem. Better get you back to the hills, which
is the place of shepherds.”</p>

<p>Ben Ezra stood firm.</p>

<p>“He must be here,” he insisted, “for so sang the angels
at Bêt Sahûr, saying, ‘In the city of David,’ which is Bethlehem.”</p>

<p>Whereupon some of the guardsmen smiled and pointed to
their heads, and some laughed jeeringly.</p>

<p>There was one, however, a tall, gentle-faced archer, who
smiled and spoke kindly, “They say a man child has come
to the stable beyond the khan, where Joseph ben David the
Nazarene and his wife have taken shelter. You might try
there.”</p>

<p>The shepherd nodded and thanked him, his dark eyes
moistly tender and in his face a light that silenced the
mockers.</p>

<p>“Thither will I go,” he exclaimed, and hurried on his way,
bowing his head reverently as he came in sight of the place.</p>

<p>Now it happened when Ben Ezra reached the stable
where Joseph ben David was abiding because of the multitude
in the khan, that he found the Child lying in a manger,
and the other shepherds who had gone before knelt beside
Him, looking into His gentle eyes and marveling. Around
them on the ground, softly bleating as if they too understood
the marvel and rejoiced in it, were the lambs the men
had brought as offerings to the Babe; and some of the
townsfolk too were there, murmuring in awed tones and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
looking on the scene in wide-eyed wonder. No one noticed
the herder who entered late, or saw him fall on his knees
beside the manger. But as his sturdy head drooped low,
the Child lifted His tiny hand as if in blessing and smiled
down on Ben Ezra’s upturned face; and then the keepers
of the sheep knew that thus God had chosen to reward him
who had not been deaf to the cry of a lamb.</p>

<p>For many a year after that time, the Syrian herders say,
Ben Ezra tended his sheep on the hills. Through summer
and winter he abode in the pasture place, his only respite
from toil being the rare visits he made to the village where
his wife and wee ones dwelt; but he never was weary, and
his flocks never went astray. To his children and his children’s
children he told the story of how he went back to the
hills that night and how he was rewarded, bidding them to
be ever mindful of the fact that he who is tender to the sheep
serves well a higher Master. And as years rolled into decades
and centuries passed away, all the herders of Judea
came to know the story and to shape their lives by it, so that
to this day the Syrian shepherds have remained men of tender
heart and simple faith. And when strangers visit the land
and wonder at the gentleness of the keepers of the flocks,
some old grandfather or brown-eyed boy is ever ready to
explain what it is that has kept them sweet and serene, and
tells the story of Ben Ezra, the shepherd who on the wonderful
night went back to the hills, and so came late to
Bethlehem.</p>

<h4>THE PET RAVEN</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Legend of the Rhine</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Geography—Ethics</i>)</p>

<p>One autumn morning a thousand years ago, a boy and a
girl stood in a forest path beside the Rhine. His great eyes,
brown and full of feeling, looked wistfully into the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
golden-haired maiden, while his clumsy hands stroked
tenderly the glossy feathers of a young raven.</p>

<p>“Father says it is a poor gift to offer a princess,” he said
as he held the bird toward her, “but I have nothing else.
Will you please take it?”</p>

<p>Blue-eyed Willeswind smiled. She was the petted child
of a baron and accustomed to receiving gifts, but something
about this boy’s earnestness touched her in an unusual way.
He was only a forester’s son, with but little to break the
monotony of his life of toil, and it seemed wonderful that he
should be willing to part with his only treasure.</p>

<p>“I cannot take your only pet, Rupert,” she said kindly,
“but it is good of you to offer it.”</p>

<p>Disappointment crept into the boy’s dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, please,” he pleaded. “I want you to have it, because
you bound up my foot with healing herbs when I tore it on
the brambles in the wood. Please take it.”</p>

<p>The girl answered with a smile that made her face very
lovely, “Of course I shall take it, and I will keep it always
because you gave it to me.” Reaching over, she took the
fluttering creature from the big dark hands, and stroked it
gently as it quivered at the strange touch. Then she made
her way back to the castle over a carpet of fallen leaves, while
Rupert the forester’s son hurried to the hunting lodge, happy
in the thought that he had made a gift to her who had been
kind to him.</p>

<p>“She will keep it and feed it and be glad I did not forget,”
he thought as he fed the falcons that evening, while up in the
castle court Willeswind was busy with her pet.</p>

<p>“See how glossy its feathers are!” she said as her brother
Othmar came near. “Rupert gave it to me, and I promised
to keep it always.”</p>

<p>The young squire laughed. “A raven is sure to be a
bother,” he said. “Better let it fly into the woods.”</p>

<p>Willeswind shook her golden head. “No, no,” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
“I like it. Your horses and hounds and falcons are
far more bother than one raven, yet you would not think of
being without them.”</p>

<p>Othmar mounted his horse and rode out to his archery
practice, thinking how soon his sister would tire of the bird.
But she did not tire of it. It was different from any pet she
had ever owned, and she cared for it and trained it.</p>

<p>Seven years passed, and the brother had grown from a
squire to a knight, and upon the death of his father the baron,
became lord of the castle. Willeswind too had changed from
the slender maid who stood under the November trees with
Rupert the forester’s son. She was now the stateliest of all
the great ladies on the Rhine. But her hair was still the
color of sun-kissed straw, and her eyes the same sympathetic
ones, as blue as wood gentians. Rupert was tall and stalwart,
one of the sturdiest vassals of Castle Stolzenfels, and
although Willeswind seldom saw him, she remembered him
kindly because he had given her the pet raven which she
still kept and loved. She spent many hours teaching it
tricks, and the bird was so clever that it learned rapidly.
Sometimes it flew into the forest and came back with flowers
and leaves for its mistress. Sometimes it winged its way
across the river and brought sprigs of the sweet wild berries
growing there.</p>

<p>Everything was bright about the castle, for the young
master and mistress were kind to those who served them,
and there were no happier vassals along the Rhine than theirs.</p>

<p>One day in springtime, when the elder flowers were creamiest
and swallows were teaching their nestlings to fly, a
stranger came riding along the river. Past the postern gate
his armored steed dashed, and straight he sat in his saddle
as he called to Lord Othmar.</p>

<p>“I bring a challenge from the great lord who is my master,”
he spoke defiantly as the young knight moved forth to meet
him. With flashing eyes he tossed his gauntlet to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>A murmur went among the vassals who stood by. To
throw down a gauntlet was to invite war, and all waited for
the master to act. But the silence was only for a minute.
Then came a shouting and clashing of arms, for with defiance
in his face Othmar picked up the glove and flung it back at
the rider. That meant war, which in those days was believed
to be a glorious thing.</p>

<p>The strange knight rode away along the Rhine shore as
rapidly as he had come, while in the great courtyard of Castle
Stolzenfels began the marshaling of vassals and preparation
for fighting. The women burnished arms and gave all the
aid they could, while the Lady Willeswind moved here and
there, making suggestions where they were needed. All
night long the sound of clanging armor was heard, and the
next morning, when the men of Castle Stolzenfels went out
of the castle gate to meet the enemy, Rupert the forester’s
son marched at the head of the vassals.</p>

<p>Willeswind stood at the tower window and watched them
go along the winding river road, thinking sadly of the days
and nights of danger into which they went. Perhaps they
would not return. Perhaps, too, some robber band might
pillage the castle while they were away, for all the able-bodied
men had gone to battle, and in those days many
brigand hordes ravaged the Rhine valley, which the handful
of old men at Stolzenfels would not be able to hold back.
But she was brave, and although danger threatened, she
faced it as a baron’s daughter should.</p>

<p>Autumn came, with swallows and martins flying southward,
and still the battling raged away in the northland,
sometimes with victory for Othmar and his men, sometimes
with defeat, but always with dread for the anxious hearts of
those who waited at home.</p>

<p>One night the wind raged like a mad thing, whipping the
Rhine into foam. As the castle mistress sat in the great
hall among the women, a servant entered, saying that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
pilgrim stood at the outer gate, begging shelter from the night
and storm.</p>

<p>“He is white and bent,” the man explained. “Shall I
let him come inside?”</p>

<p>Willeswind’s heart was big and tender. “Yes, let him
come,” she said.</p>

<p>A moment later he followed the servant through the hall
to the sleeping quarters, a hobbling figure leaning heavily
on a staff. Willeswind pitied him as he went by, but
thought his face seemed hard and cruel.</p>

<p>A few days later she sat alone with her maid, in that same
great hall, looking happier than she had looked for many
weeks. “A courier came by with word from Othmar,” she
said. “He sends greetings, says the worst of the fighting is
over, and soon they will be home. I feel quite safe again.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the door was violently thrust open. The maid
screamed and Willeswind turned pale, for a man in heavy
armor strode into the room. She knew he was one of the
dreaded robber barons who terrorized the Rhine valley, and
knew too, as she looked into his savage face, that it was the
same man who, in the guise of a pilgrim, had sought shelter
there a few nights before.</p>

<p>“I have come to take you with me,” he said in a voice of
thunder, “for I mean you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>Willeswind shuddered. She knew how wicked and cruel he
was, and that it was her great wealth he craved, for Stolzenfels
was one of the richest estates on the river. “That can
never be, sir,” she answered haughtily. “So go back whence
you came.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with an evil smile. “You give me a
blithe refusal now,” he exclaimed, “but in three days I will
come again and it will be sad for you if I get not a different
answer.”</p>

<p>The robber chief strode out, and Willeswind and the
trembling maid looked at each other in terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>“My lady,” the woman spoke, as soon as the outer gate
clanged and they knew the man was beyond hearing, “you
must get away from here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the mistress, “I must leave Stolzenfels
and seek refuge at some other castle.”</p>

<p>So that same afternoon a little cavalcade wended its way
through the woods, over the carpet of leaves that late autumn
had whipped from the trees. It was Willeswind and her
attendants, bound for the home of another baron, where she
would be protected until the return of Othmar and his men.
Beside her rode Hulda the maid, and on her shoulder sat the
pet raven.</p>

<p>But they did not go far. Suddenly from behind some
thickly growing brush a band of horsemen appeared. One
rider, taller and heavier than the others, called out orders to
his men.</p>

<p>“To my castle!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Willeswind knew well they were the tones of the robber
baron, and that she was now a prisoner in his power.</p>

<p>Sad indeed was her heart as the men turned her horse’s
head away from her road to safety, and tears came into her
blue eyes as she caught a glimpse of the Stolzenfels towers.</p>

<p>“Oh, my home,” she murmured, “when shall I see you
again?”</p>

<p>On they went through the forest, along that part of the
river whose gray cliffs she had known since childhood, then
into unfamiliar country as they neared the castle of the
robber chief.</p>

<p>“If only they will let us stay together,” she murmured to
Hulda as they drew rein at the gate.</p>

<p>They rode in through the courtyard, and then, dismounting,
the baron led the two women up a winding stairway to
the tower.</p>

<p>“Here you may stay,” he said savagely, “and decide what
to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, striding out, he bolted the heavy door.</p>

<p>They looked around. The windows were covered with
an iron grating, and there was no possible way of escape.</p>

<p>“We cannot get away,” said Hulda, “so let us make the
best of it and find something to eat, for I am hungry.”</p>

<p>But there was no food about the place, and they realized
then that he meant to starve Willeswind into obeying him.</p>

<p>But suddenly a bright thought came to her, and she smiled.</p>

<p>“He cannot do it, though, for I have my raven.” And
stroking its glossy wings she said, “Berries, pet, berries.”</p>

<p>Her hours of training had been well spent. For as if it
understood, the bird spread its shining wings and flew out
between the grating. After a while it returned with a sprig
of crimson berries, the fragrant, juicy Rhine buds, and laid
them in its mistress’ lap.</p>

<p>Many trips it made during the days that followed, and the
woodland fruit kept the women from starvation, for it contained
both nourishment and water.</p>

<p>So, instead of growing weak and wan, they kept their
strength, and the baron could not understand how, with
neither food nor water, Willeswind remained strong and well,
and as defiant as ever. But to Willeswind and Hulda it was
no mystery, and they were full of gratitude to the raven.</p>

<p>One morning Hulda stood by the window, looking out over
the woods at the sunlight on the river. Suddenly she gave
an excited cry. “Some horsemen are riding up the Rhine
road!” she exclaimed. “They are coming this way.”</p>

<p>Willeswind flew to the casement and watched as they drew
near. Straight along the forest path they advanced, so close
that the watchers could see their faces.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the lady of Stolzenfels. “It is Othmar and
his men. The war is over and they are coming home.”</p>

<p>She called loudly, waving her handkerchief between the
grating, and Othmar saw and heard. “We are up here,
prisoners in the tower!” she shouted, as he galloped nearer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
And a minute later the Stolzenfels men were battering at the
castle gate.</p>

<p>“For your mistress, comrades!” called Rupert the
forester’s son, as he led the charge.</p>

<p>The robber baron knew the Stolzenfels force was too strong
for him to hold out against, for with right on their side they
had even greater strength. He surrendered, and the captives
were freed.</p>

<p>The Stolzenfels towers never looked as fair to their owners,
as when on the return they beheld them through the trees.
It was a joyful homecoming to both lord and vassal, and to
the raven, for he flew in and out of its windows as if overcome
with gladness. Othmar watched its joyous flight with a
smile.</p>

<p>“We will always keep the bird,” he said, “for it saved you
from the baron’s power.”</p>

<p>And they did keep it until it died. Then, in memory of
its service, they placed its stone image on the castle gate and
carved its likeness on the Stolzenfels shield.</p>

<p>Centuries passed. The robber bands that had been the
terror of the Rhine valley became a part of the past, and
Castle Stolzenfels fell into decay, for hundreds of years being
one of the noblest ruins on the river. Then the German
emperor restored it. He rebuilt the crumbling towers and
bastions where bats made their nests, furnished it after the
fashion of long ago, and today it is a favorite summer home
of the imperial family. And still on the outer gate a stone
raven stands, and to all who know the Rhine stories it speaks
eloquently of that olden time when knights were bold, and
of a gratitude offering made by the forester’s son to the
daughter of the castle.</p>

<h4>JUSSIEU AND THE HELIOTROPE</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Science—Nature Study</i>)</p>

<p>In the year of Our Lord 1735, Joseph de Jussieu, the
famous botanist, came into the presence of Louis the Fifteenth
and besought him to give his royal sanction to a
mission that was considered very wonderful in those days.</p>

<p>“I would go to South America to study the plant life there,”
he said, “and mayhap I may discover something that will
bring glory to France.”</p>

<p>The king looked with favor upon the venture, and a little
later the botanist and his attendants sailed out of the port of
Havre, toward the distant land of the Andes.</p>

<p>Many months they were on the way, now tossing on the
high seas at the mercy of wind and wave, now threading a
perilous path through the selvas. At last they ascended the
snow-capped Cordilleras, examining every tree and plant they
found.</p>

<p>“We will take back seeds of every rare specimen,” Jussieu
said, “and great will be the rejoicing in France.”</p>

<p>One day, as the botanist and his men made their way from
a deep ravine up a sunny slope, they smelled something wonderfully
fragrant.</p>

<p>“Such a powerful odor must come from a gigantic, gorgeous
flower,” the naturalist said. And they searched eagerly,
each man anxious to discover the prize. But the only gorgeous
flower they found was a clump of flaming peonies,
which, although regally beautiful, were devoid of fragrance.</p>

<p>Then one of the men stumbled upon a plant bearing
clusters of tiny purple blossoms. The odor was very heavy
around it, and he knew he had found the perfume giver.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed in disappointment, “it is not half so
stately as our fleur-de-lis.”</p>

<p>Jussieu came and examined it with great interest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
although it was a small, unpretentious flower, thought it a
precious find. He noticed that the most perfect blossoms
were on the sunny side of the plant, and that they seemed to
reach the sun. He named it “heliotrope,” from Greek words
meaning “to turn toward the sun,” and when he returned to
France took with him some of the seeds, which were planted
in the royal garden.</p>

<p>The princesses, who were always looking for something
novel, became greatly excited about the purple blossoms
from the Andes. They called it the flower of love, and no
bouquet was deemed fit to offer a court lady that did not contain
at least a sprig of it. Being greatly in demand, it was
very costly. People speculated in it, and for a time fortunes
were won and lost, as during the tulip craze in Holland.</p>

<p>Then, after a while, when all the florists grew quantities
of heliotrope, it became so common that it went out of favor
as the court flower. But it was just as popular as ever, because
it had lost none of its grace and fragrance. It grew
in the gardens of the people, and there was no peasant too
poor to own a plant.</p>

<p>So the dainty heliotrope that is still the favorite of the
gardens is a traveled and storied flower. It grew on the slope
of the Andes. It crossed the broad seas and was planted in
a royal garden. It gladdened the peasants and townsfolk
of Lorraine and Brittany and Provence, and still it scatters
its fragrance and reaches out its petals toward the sun.</p>

<h4>THE FALL OF LONDON BRIDGE</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>History</i>)</p>

<p>Almost everybody, whether he be ten or seventy-five, has
played the good old game of London Bridge, but not everybody
knows that once upon a time the bridge really did fall
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>It was nine hundred years ago—before William the Conqueror
was born, and the United States had not even been
thought of. Up in the cold, white northland lived a race
of fearless vikings, and down in pleasant England reigned
a weak, unable king. His name was Ethelred, and because
he was always behind time with his plans and his work,
people called him the Unready, and in the day in which
he lived it was a very serious thing for a king to be
unready.</p>

<p>Ever since the Danes had discovered what a fair land
England was, they had wanted to take it. They came with
their armies in King Alfred’s time. They returned again
during the reign of his sons, and when young Ethelred ascended
the throne and word went forth of how unable and
unready he was, their boats brought a mighty army and surrounded
the island. Danish soldiers camped on the broad
English moorlands, Danish songs echoed through the woods
of Kent and Surrey and sounded in the streets of London
town. The invaders were in full possession of the city.
They held the royal castle, and their generals slept in King
Ethelred’s beds, while he had to take a bunk wherever he
could find one. They were bold, brave, and strong. They
had leaders who knew not the meaning of fear and were always
ready, and it seemed that this time they would take the
kingdom.</p>

<p>Yet they didn’t take it after all, for there were other brave,
bold men who came to Ethelred’s aid.</p>

<p>Twenty ships sailed down from the seas of Norway, twenty
goodly vessels bearing blue and crimson sails, for the boy
king Olaf, who dwelt in the far north country, had heard of
the plight of Ethelred the Unready and said to his men,
“Let us go and fight for him as we fight for our own land.”</p>

<p>At these words the soldiers cheered and bent to the oars,
and thus they went to England.</p>

<p>In from the sea they came and up the broad green Thames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
toward London town. The people along the river despaired
at sight of their standard, for they thought another army
was coming to attack them. But the sorrow turned to rejoicing
when King Ethelred met them just below the city,
and Olaf said, in loud, clear tones, “I have brought my
soldiers to fight for thee.”</p>

<p>Then there rang out such a blast of welcome as never
English war horns sounded before or since.</p>

<p>Olaf lost no time. The men of the north country fought
for the love of fighting, and he was eager to hurl his army
against the Danes.</p>

<p>“First we will take the fort they have built to command
the Thames,” he exclaimed. “Then we will drive them
from the city.”</p>

<p>King Ethelred shook his head.</p>

<p>“It will not be easy to do that,” he said. “Thrice already
my army has tried it, but the Danish soldiers are thick on
London Bridge. We cannot get near enough to attack the
fort, because whenever the ships start up the river arrows
and spears and stones come down upon them and they are
driven back.”</p>

<p>King Olaf stood thinking and did not answer. Finally
he said, “Then we must tear down the bridge.”</p>

<p>Ethelred looked at him as if he thought him crazy. “Tear
down the bridge!” he repeated in amazement. “That is
impossible. London Bridge is strong, and neither of us has
an army of giants.”</p>

<p>Young Olaf looked at him and smiled, thinking how little
this man knew of warfare.</p>

<p>“Do as I bid you,” he said, “and you shall see it fall.”</p>

<p>Ethelred had little faith in the viking’s words, but he was
in so terrible a plight that he was willing to do anything that
might pull him out of it. Who wouldn’t be, with a Danish
general sleeping in his bed?</p>

<p>King Olaf gave some orders to his men. Then he said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Ethelred, “Bring your ships alongside mine, and we will get
them ready.”</p>

<p>He ordered the men to make broad, flat roofs for every
vessel, for he knew they could not tear down London Bridge
unless protected from the spears and arrows of the Danes.
The enemy had seized so much of King Ethelred’s lumber
that he hadn’t half enough to make the roofs, so they tore
down houses that the command might be carried out.</p>

<p>Finally everything was ready, and the fleet of England
and the fleet of Norway moved side by side up the Thames.
The Danish soldiers laughed as they saw the queer-looking
vessels coming toward them, thinking what fun it would be
to drive back the boats of Ethelred the Unready, as they had
done several times before. But the Danes didn’t know as
much as they thought they knew, and although their spears
and arrows flew fast, the lumbering warships came on.</p>

<p>Then the soldiers on the bridge shot their bows and threw
their javelins as they had not done before. They hurled
great rocks down upon the vessels, damaging some of them
so much that they had to turn back. But they did not harm
or frighten Olaf the viking. He called to his men and cheered
them on, and nearer, nearer these good ships came, until they
were close to the piles of London Bridge.</p>

<p>Then they stopped a moment, still under the rain of stones
and spears and arrows, and the Danish soldiers wondered
what it meant. They could not see the thick, strong cables
that were wound around the heavy supports of the bridge.
They could not see the soldiers of Olaf lash the other ends
fast to the vessels. But a moment later they understood
all they had not seen. The ships turned with a sudden
spurt. The Danish soldiers felt a mighty tug and pull. The
roofed warships darted down the river, and then was heard
the fall of London Bridge.</p>

<p>How joyfully the men of England shouted, for now they
could push ahead and attack the fort. They took it too, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
drove the enemy out of the city. Danish warriors no longer
slept under satin covers in the castle of King Ethelred.
Danish songs no longer resounded through the woods of
Kent and Surrey and across the broad, sea-lapped moorlands.
The soldiers routed the Danes and drove them out of the
country, and Olaf the boy viking sailed back to his far, white
northland, rejoicing in the thought that he had saved his
kingdom to Ethelred, which he could not have done but for
the fall of London Bridge.</p>

<h4>HOW THEY CAME TO HAVE KITE DAY IN CHINA</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retold from a Chinese Folk Tale</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Physical Education</i>)</p>

<p>In the lovely province of Kwang Tung, a sage named
Ng Chew lived in the far-off time. He not only was versed in
the lore of past and present, but knew future events as well,
and used his knowledge and his power to benefit mankind.</p>

<p>One night in a vision he saw that a pestilence was about
to sweep over the valley in which he lived, and his first thought
was that he must save his people. He went from house
to house telling the news and bidding every one flee with
him to the mountains, and a few hours after he started on
his mission the homes in the lowlands were deserted.</p>

<p>Up on the heights the people were safe in the crisp, clean
air. But after many days had passed they wanted to return
to their homes. They thought of the growth in the rice
fields and of the approaching harvest time. “We have been
here long enough,” they declared. “By this time the danger
is over and we ought to go back.” But the wise Ng
Chew knew it was not safe to return, and urged them to stay.
There were a few who would not listen to his words. They
started back to the lowlands, and Ng Chew wondered how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
could keep the others on the mountain. Then a happy
thought crossed his mind. He set everybody to making
and flying kites, and soon had them so interested that they
were glad to stay.</p>

<p>Days afterward, when he knew the danger was past, he
led them back to the valley. Then they realized what a
blessed thing he had done in keeping them on the mountain,
for all who had refused to stay there with him had died of
the pestilence.</p>

<p>The people’s hearts were filled with gratitude toward the
man who had saved them.</p>

<p>“We will honor Ng Chew as long as he lives,” they said.
“When his birthday comes we will all fly kites.”</p>

<p>This they did. Each year, on the birthday of Ng Chew,
they left the rice fields and spent the day flying kites.</p>

<p>The word spread beyond the little valley and from province
to province, until all over the land kite flying marked
the birthday of the sage of Kwang Tung. The wise man
died and centuries passed, but still the Chinese keep Kite
Day, honoring him who in the long ago led his people to
safety in the mountains.</p>

<h4>THE STORY OF A STONE</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By David Starr Jordan</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Science</i>)</p>

<p>Once on a time, a great many years ago, so many, many
years that one grows very tired in trying to think how long
ago it was; in those old days when the great Northwest consisted
of a few ragged and treeless hills, full of copper and
quartz, bordered by a dreary waste of sand flats, over which
the Gulf of Mexico rolled its warm and turbid waters as far
north as Escanaba and Eau Claire; in the days when Marquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Harbor opened out towards Baffin’s Bay, and the
Northern Ocean washed the crest of Mount Washington and
wrote its name upon the Pictured Rocks; when the tide of
the Pacific, hemmed in by no snow-capped Sierras, came
rushing through the Golden Gate between the Ozarks and the
north peninsula of Michigan, and swept over Plymouth Rock
and surged up against Bunker Hill; in the days when it would
have been fun to study geography, for there were no capitals,
nor any products, and all the towns were seaports—in fact,
an immensely long time ago there lived somewhere in the
northeastern part of the state of Wisconsin, not far from the
city of Oconto, a little jellyfish. It was a curious little fellow,
about the shape of half an apple, and the size of a pin’s head;
and it floated around in the water, and ate little things, and
opened and shut its umbrella pretty much as the jellyfishes do
now on a sunny day off Nahant Beach when the tide is coming
in. It had a great many little feelers that hung down all
around like so many little snakes; so it was named Medusa,
after a queer woman who lived a long while ago, when all
sorts of stories were true. She wore snakes instead of hair,
and used to turn people into stone images if they dared to
make faces at her. So this little Medusa floated around,
and opened and shut her umbrella for a good while,—a
month or two, perhaps; we don’t know how long. Then
one morning, down among the seaweeds, she laid a whole
lot of tiny eggs, transparent as crab-apple jelly, and smaller
than the dewdrop on the end of a pine leaf. That was the
last thing she did; then she died, and our story henceforth
concerns only one of those little eggs.</p>

<p>One day the sun shone down into the water—the same sun
that shines over the Oconto sawmills now—and touched
these eggs with life; and a little fellow whom we will call
Favosites, because that was his name, woke up inside the
egg, and came out into the world. He was only a little piece
of floating jelly, shaped like a cartridge pointed at both ends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
or like a grain of barley, although very much smaller. He
had a great number of little paddles on his sides. These
kept flapping all the time, so that he was constantly in motion.
And at night all these little paddles shone with a rich green
light, to show him the way through the water. It would
have done you good to see them some night when all the little
fellows had their lamps burning at once, and every wave as
it rose and fell was all aglow with Nature’s fireworks, which
do not burn the fingers and leave no smell of sulphur.</p>

<p>So the little Favosites kept scudding along in the water,
dodging from one side to the other to avoid the ugly creatures
that tried to eat him. There were crabs and clams of a
fashion neither you nor I shall ever see alive. There were
huge animals with great eyes, savage jaws like the beak of a
snapping turtle and surrounded by long feelers. They sat
in the end of a long, round shell, shaped like a length of stove
pipe, and glowered like an owl in a hollow log; and there were
smaller ones that looked like lobsters in a dinner horn. But
none of these caught the little fellow, else I should not have
had this story to tell.</p>

<p>At last, having paddled about long enough, Favosites
thought of settling in life. So he looked around till he found
a flat bit of shell that just suited him. Then he sat down
upon it and grew fast, like old Holger Danske in the Danish
myth, or Frederick Barbarossa in the German one. He did
not go to sleep, however, but proceeded to make himself a
home. He had no head, but between his shoulders he made
an opening which would serve him for mouth and stomach.
Then he put a whole row of feelers out, and commenced
catching little worms and floating eggs and bits of jelly and
bits of lime,—everything he could get,—and cramming
them into his mouth. He had a great many curious ways,
but the funniest of them all was what he did with the bits of
lime. He kept taking them in, and tried to wall himself up
inside with them, as a person would “stone a well,” or as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
though a man should swallow pebbles and stow them away
in his feet and all around under the skin, till he had filled
himself all full with them, as the man filled Jim Smiley’s
frog.</p>

<p>Little Favosites became lonesome all alone in the bottom
of that old ocean among so many outlandish neighbors. So
one night, when he was fast asleep and dreaming as only a
coral animal can dream, there sprouted out from his side,
somewhere near where his sixth rib might have been if he had
had any ribs, another little Favosites; and this one very
soon began to eat worms and to wall himself up as if for dear
life. Then from these two another and another little bud
came out, and other little Favosites were formed. They all
kept growing up higher and cramming themselves fuller and
fuller of stone, till at last there were so many and they were
so crowded together that there was not room for them to
grow round, and so they had to become six-sided like the cells
of a honeycomb. Once in a while some one in the company
would feel jealous because the others got more of the worms,
or would feel uneasy at sitting still so long and swallowing
lime. Such a one would secede from the little union without
even saying “good-by,” and would put on the airs of the
grandmother Medusa, and would sail around in the water,
opening and shutting its umbrella, at last laying more eggs,
which for all we know may have hatched out into more
Favosites.</p>

<p>So the old Favosites died, or ran away, or were walled up
by the younger ones, and new ones filled their places, and the
colony thrived for a long while, until it had accumulated a
large stock of lime.</p>

<p>But one day there came a freshet in the Menominee River,
or in some other river, and piles of dirt and sand and mud
were brought down, and all the little Favosites’ mouths were
filled with it. This they did not like, and so they died; but
we know that the rock house they were building was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
spoiled, for we have it here. But it was tumbled about a
good deal in the dirt, and the rolling pebbles knocked the
corners off, and the mud worked into the cracks, and its
beautiful color was destroyed. There it lay in the mud for
ages, till the earth gave a great, long heave that raised Wisconsin
out of the ocean, and the mud around our little
Favosites packed and dried into hard rock and closed it in.
So it became part of the dry land, and lay embedded in the
rocks for centuries and centuries, while the old-fashioned
ferns grew above it, and whispered to it strange stories of
what was going on above ground in the land where things
were living.</p>

<p>Then the time of the first fishes came, and the other animals
looked in wonder at them, as the Indians looked on Columbus.
Some of them were like the little gar-pike of our river here,
only much larger,—big as a stove pipe, and with a crust as
hard as a turtle’s. Then there were sharks, of strange forms,
and some of them had teeth like bowie knives, with tempers
to match. And the time of the old fishes came and went,
and many more times came and went, but still Favosites lay
in the ground at Oconto.</p>

<p>Then came the long, hot, wet summer, when the mists
hung over the earth so thick that you might have had to
cut your way through them with a knife; and great ferns
and rushes, big as an oak and tall as a steeple, grew in the
swamps of Indiana and Illinois. Their green plumes were
so long and so densely interwoven that the Man in the Moon
might have fancied that the earth was feathering out. Then
all about, huge reptiles, with jaws like the gates of doom and
teeth like cross-cut saws, and little reptiles with wings like
bats, crawled, and swam, and flew.</p>

<p>But the ferns died, and the reptiles died, and the rush
trees fell in the swamps, and the Illinois and the Sangamon
and the Wabash and all the other rivers covered them up.
They stewed away under layers of clay and sand, till at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
they turned into coal and wept bitter tears of petroleum.
But all this while Favosites lay in the rocks in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Then the mists cleared away, and the sun shone, and the
grass began to grow, and strange animals came from somewhere
or nowhere to feed upon it. There were queer little
striped horses, with three or four hoofs on each foot, and no
bigger than a Newfoundland dog, but as smart as ever you
saw. There were great hairy elephants, with teeth like
sticks of wood. There were hogs with noses so long that
they could sit on their hind legs and root. And there were
many still stranger creatures which no man ever saw alive.
But still Favosites lay in the ground and waited.</p>

<p>And the long, long summer passed by, and the autumn, and
the Indian summer. At last the winter came, and it snowed
and snowed, and it was so cold that the snow did not go off
till the Fourth of July. Then it snowed and snowed till the
snow did not go off at all. And then it became so cold that
it snowed all the time, till the snow covered the animals, and
then the trees, and then the mountains. Then it would
thaw a little, and streams of water would run over the snow.
Then it would freeze again, and the snow would pack into
solid ice. So it went on snowing and thawing and freezing,
till nothing but snowbanks could be seen in Wisconsin, and
most of Indiana was fit only for a skating rink. And the
animals and plants which could get away, all went south to
live, and the others died and were frozen into the snow.</p>

<p>So it went on for a great many years. I dare not tell you
how long, for you might not believe me. Then the spring
came, the south winds blew, and the snow began to thaw.
Then the ice came sliding down from the mountains and hills
and from the north toward the south. It went on, tearing
up rocks, little and big, from the size of a chip to the size of
a house, crushing forests as you would crush an eggshell, and
wiping out rivers as you would wipe out a chalk mark. So
it came pushing, grinding, thundering along,—not very fast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
you understand, but with tremendous force, like a plow
drawn by a million oxen, for a thousand feet of ice is very
heavy. And the ice plow scraped over Oconto, and little
Favosites was torn from the place where he had lain so long;
but by good fortune he happened to fall into a crevice of the
ice where he was not much crowded, else he would have been
ground to powder and I should not have had this story to
tell. And the ice melted as it slid along, and it made great
torrents of water, which, as they swept onward, covered the
land with clay and pebbles. At last the ice came to a great
swamp overgrown with tamarack and balsam. It melted
here; and all the rocks and stones and dirt it had carried—little
Favosites and all—were dumped into one great
heap.</p>

<p>It was a very long time after, and man had been created,
and America had been discovered, and the War of the Revolution
and the Civil War had all been fought to the end, and
a great many things had happened, when one day a farmer
living near Grand Chute, in Outagamie County, Wisconsin,
was plowing up his clover field to sow to winter wheat. He
picked up in the furrow a curious little bit of “petrified
honeycomb,” a good deal worn and dirty, but still showing
plainly the honey cells and the bee bread. Then he put it
into his pocket and carried it home, and gave it to his boy
Charley to take to the teacher and hear what he would say
about it. And this is what he said.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<p>For additional contact information:</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
